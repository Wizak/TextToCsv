purchaser sharpes tiger is for muir sutherland and malcolm craddock with many thanks chapter it was funny richard sharpe thought that there were no vultures in england none that he had seen anyway ugly things they were rats with wings he thought about vultures a lot and he had a lot of time to think because he was a soldier a private and so the army insisted on doing a lot of his thinking for him the army decided when he woke up when he slept when he ate when he marched and when he was to sit about doing nothing and that was what he did most of the time nothing hurry up and do nothing that was the armys way of doing things and he was fed up with it he was bored and thinking of running him and mary run away desert he was thinking about it now and it was an odd thing to worry about right now because the army was about to give richard sharpe his first proper battle he had been in one fight but that was five years ago and it had been a messy confused business in fog and no one had known why the rd regiment was in flanders or what they were supposed to be doing there and in the end they had done nothing except fire some shots at the mistshrouded french and the whole thing had been over almost before young richard sharpe had known it had begun he had seen a couple of men killed he remembered sergeant hawthornes death best because the sergeant had been hit by a musket ball that drove a rib clean out of his red coat there was hardly a drop of blood to be seen just the white rib sticking out of the faded red cloth you could hang your hat on that hawthorne had said in a tone of wonder then he had sobbed and after that he had choked up blood and collapsed sharpe had gone on loading and firing and then just as he was beginning to enjoy himself the battalion had marched away and sailed back to england some batde now he was in india he did not know why he was invading mysore and hor did he particularly care king george iii wanted richard sharpe to be in india so in india richard sharpe was but richard sharpe had now become bored with the kings service he was young and he reckoned life had more to offer than hurrying up and doing nothing there was money to be made he was not sure how to make money except by thieving but he did know that he was bored and that he could do better than stay on the bottom of the dungheap that was where he was he kept telling himself the bottom of a dungheap and everyone knew what was piled on top of a dungheap better to run he told himself all that was needed to get ahead in the world was a bit of sense and the ability to kick a bastard faster than the bastard could kick you and richard sharpe reckoned he had those talents right enough though where to run in india half the natives seemed to be in british pay and those would turn you in for a handful of tin pice and the pice was only worth a farthing and the other indians were all fighting against the british or readying to fight them and if he ran to them he would just be forced to serve in their armies he would fetch more pay in a native army probably far more than the tuppence a day sharpe got now after stoppages but why change one uniform for another no he would have to run to some place where the army would never find him or else it would be the firing squad on some hot morning a blast of musket shots a scrape in the red earth for a grave and next day the rats with wings would be yanking the guts out of your belly like a bunch of blackbirds tugging worms out of a lawn that was why he was thinking about vultures he was thinking that he wanted to run but that he did not want to feed the vultures do not get caught rule number one in the army and the only rule that mattered because if you got caught the bastards would flog you to death or else reorganize your ribs with musket balls and either way the vultures got fat the vultures were always there sometimes circling on long wings that tilted to the sudden winds of the warm upper air and sometimes standing hunched on branches they fed on death and a marching army gave them a gluttons diet and now in this last year of the eighteenth century two allied armies were crossing this hot fertile plain in southern india one was a british army and the other belonged to a british ally the nizam of hyderabad and both armies provided a feast of vulture fodder horses died oxen died camels died even two of the elephants that had seemed so indestructible had died and then the people died the twin armies had a tail ten times longer than themselves a great sprawl of camp followers merchants herders whores wives and children and among all of those people as it did among the armies themselves the plagues ran riot men died with bloody dysentery or shaking with a fever or choking on their own vomit they died struggling for breath or drenched in sweat or raving like mad things or with skins blistered raw men women and children all died and whether they were buried or burned it did not matter because in the end the vultures fed on them anyway for there was never enough time nor sufficient timber to make a proper funeral pyre and so the vultures would rip the halfcooked flesh off the scorched bones and if the bodies were buried then no amount of stones heaped on the soil would stop the scavenging beasts from digging up the swollen rotting flesh and the vultures hooked beaks took what the ravenous teeth left behind and this hot march day promised food in abundance and the vultures seemed to sense it for as the early afternoon passed more and more birds joined the spiring column of wings that circled above the marching men the birds did not flap their wings but simply soared in the warm air as they glided tilted slid and waited always waited as if they knew that deaths succulence would fill their gullets soon enough ugly bastard birds sharpe said just rats with wings but no one in the rds light company answered him no one had the breath to answer him the air was choking from the dust kicked up by the men ahead so that the rearward ranks stumbled through a warm gritty mix that parched their throats and stung their eyes most of the men were not even aware of the vultures while others were so weary that they had not even noticed the troop of cavalry that had suddenly appeared a halfmile to the north the horsemen trotted beside a grove of trees that were bright with red blossom then accelerated away their drawn sabres flashed reflected sunlight as they wheeled away from the infantrymen but then as inexplicably as they had hurried and swerved away they suddenly stopped sharpe noticed them british cavalry they were the fancy boys come to see how proper soldiers fought ahead from the low rise of land where a second group of horsemen was silhouetted against the furnace whiteness of the sky a gun fired the crack of the cannon was immense a billow of sound that punched hollow and malignant across the plain the guns smoke billowed white as the heavy ball thrashed into some bushes tore leaves and blossoms to tatters struck dust from the baked ground then ran on in ever decreasing bounces to lodge against a gnarled fallen tree from which a pale shower of decaying wood spurted the shot had missed the redcoated infantry by a good two hundred paces but the sound of the cannon woke up the weary jesus a voice in the rear file said what was that a bleeding camel farted what the hell do you think it was a corporal answered it was a bloody awful shot sharpe said my mother could lay a gun better than that i didnt think you had a mother private garrard said everyones got a mother tom not sergeant hakeswill garrard said then spat a mix of dust and spittle the column of men had momentarily halted not because of any orders but rather because the cannon shot had unnerved the officer leading the front company who was no longer sure exactly where he was supposed to lead the battalion hakeswill wasnt born of a mother garrard said vehemently he took off his shako and used his sleeve to wipe the dust and sweat from his face the woollen sleeve left a faint trace of red dye on his forehead hakeswill was spawned of the devil garrard said jamming the shako back on his whitepowdered hair sharpe wondered whether tom garrard would run with him two men might survive better than one and what about mary would she come he thought about mary a lot when he was not thinking about everything else except that mary was inextricably twisted into everything else it was confusing she was sergeant bickerstaffs widow and she was half indian and half english and she was twentytwo which was the same age as sharpe or at least he thought it was the same age it could be that he was twentyone or twentythree he was not really sure on account of not ever having had a mother to tell him of course he did have a mother everyone had a mother but not everyone had a cat lane whore for a mother who disappeared just after her son was born the child had been named for the wealthy patron of the foundling home that had raised him but the naming had not brought richard sharpe any patronage only brought him to the reeking bottom of the armys dungheap still sharpe reckoned he could have a future and mary spoke one or two indian languages which could be useful if he and tom did run the cavalry off to sharpes right spurred into a trot again and disappeared beyond the redblossomed trees leaving only a drifting cloud of dust behind two galloper guns light sixpounder cannons followed them bouncing dangerously on the uneven ground behind their teams of horses every other cannon in the army was drawn by oxen but the galloper guns had horse teams that were three times as fast as the plodding draught cattle the lone enemy cannon fired again its brutal sound punching the warm air with an almost palpable impact sharpe could see more enemy guns on the ridge but they were smaller than the gun that had just fired and sharpe presumed they did not have the long range of the bigger cannon then he saw a trace of grey in the air a flicker like a vertical pencil stroke drawn against the pale blue sky and he knew that the big guns shot must be coming straight towards him and he knew too that there was no wind to carry the heavy ball gently aside and all that he realized in the second or so that the ball was in the air too short a time to react only to recognize deaths approach but then the ball slammed into the ground a dozen paces short of him and bounced on up over his head to run harmlessly into a field of sugar cane i reckon the bastards have got your mother laying the gun now dick garrard said no talking now sergeant hakeswills voice screeched suddenly save your godless breath was that you talking garrard not me sarge aint got the breath you aint got the breath sergeant hakeswill came hurrying down the companys ranks and thrust his face up towards garrard you aint got the breath that means youre dead private garrard dead no use to king or country if yous dead but you never was any bleeding use anyway the sergeants malevolent eyes flicked to sharpe was it you talking sharpie not me sarge you aint got orders to talk if the king wanted you to have a conversation id have told you so says so in the scriptures give me your firelock sharpie quick now sharpe handed his musket to the sergeant it was hakeswills arrival in the company that had persuaded sharpe that it was time to run from the army he had been bored anyway but hakeswill had added injustice to boredom not that sharpe cared about injustice for only the rich had justice in this world but hakeswills injustice was touched with such malevolence that there was hardly a man in the light company not ready to rebel and all that kept them from mutiny was the knowledge that hakeswill understood their desire wanted it and wanted to punish them for it he was a great man for provoking insolence and then punishing it he was always two steps ahead of you waiting round a corner with a bludgeon he was a devil was hakeswill a devil in a smart red coat decorated with a sergeants badges yet to look at hakeswill was to see the perfect soldier it was true that his oddly lumpy face twitched every few seconds as though an evil spirit was twisting and jerking just beneath his sunreddened skin but his eyes were blue his hair was powdered as white as the snow that never fell on this land and his uniform was as smart as though he stood guard at windsor castle he performed drill like a prussian each movement so crisp and clean that it was a pleasure to watch but then the face would twitch and his oddly childlike eyes would flicker a sideways glance and you could see the devil peering out back when he had been a recruiting sergeant hakeswill had taken care not to let the devil show and that was when sharpe had first met him but now when the sergeant no longer needed to gull and trick young fools into the ranks hakeswill did not care who saw his malignancy sharpe stood motionless as the sergeant untied the scrap of rag that sharpe used to protect his muskets lock from the insidious red dust hakeswill peered at the lock found nothing wrong then turned away from sharpe so that the sun could fall full on the weapon he peered again cocked the gun dryfired it then seemed to lose interest in the musket as a group of officers spurred their horses towards the head of the stalled column company hakeswill shouted company shun the men shuffled their feet together and straightened as the three officers galloped past hakeswill had stiffened into a grotesque pose his right boot tucked behind his left his legs straight his head and shoulders thrown back his belly thrust forward and his bent elbows straining to meet in the concavity at the small of his back none of the other companies of the kings rd regiment had been stood to attention in honour of the passing officers but hakeswills gesture of respect was nevertheless ignored the neglect had no effect on the sergeant who when the trio of officers had gone past shouted at the company to stand easy and then peered again at sharpes musket youll not find owt wrong with it sarge sharpe said hakeswill still standing at attention did an elaborate about turn his right boot thumping down to the ground did i hear me give you permission to speak sharpie no sarge no sarge no you did not flogging offence that sharpie hakeswills right cheek twitched with the involuntary spasm that disfigured his face every few seconds and the vehement evil of the face was suddenly so intense that the whole light company momentarily held its breath in expectation of sharpes arrest but then the thumping discharge of the enemy cannon rolled across the countryside and the heavy ball splashed and bounced and tore its way through a brightgreen patch of growing rice and the violence of the harmless missile served to distract hakeswill who turned to watch as the ball rolled to a stop poor bloody shooting hakeswill said scathingly heathens cant lay guns i dare say or maybe theyre toying with us toying the thought made him laugh it was not sharpe suspected the anticipation of excitement that had brought sergeant obadiah hakeswill to this state of near joviality but rather the thought that a battle would cause casualties and misery and misery was the sergeants delight he liked to see men cowed and frightened for that made them biddable and sergeant hakeswill was always at his happiest when he was in control of unhappy men the three officers had stopped their horses at the head of the column and now used telescopes to inspect the distant ridge which was clouded by a ragged fringe of smoke left from the last discharge of the enemy cannon thats our colonel boys hakeswill announced to the rds light company colonel arthur wellesley himself god bless him for a gentleman which he is and you aint hes come to see you fight so make sure you do fight like the englishmen you are im a scot a sour voice spoke from the rear rank i heard that who said that hakeswill glared at the company his face twitching uncontrollably in a less blithe mood the sergeant would have ferreted out the speaker and punished him but the excitement of pending battle persuaded him to let the offence pass a scot he said derisively instead what is the finest thing a scotsman ever saw answer me that no one did the high road to england thats what says so in the scriptures so it must be true he hefted sharpes musket as he looked down the waiting ranks i shall be watching you he snarled you aint none of you been in a proper fight before not a proper fight but on the other side of that bleeding hill theres a horde of blackfaced heathens what cant wait to lay their filthy hands on your womenfolk so if so much as one of you turns his back ill have the skin off the lot of you bare bones and blood thats what youll be but you does your duty and obeys your orders and you cant go wrong and who gives the orders the sergeant waited for an answer and eventually private mallinson offered one the officers sergeant the officers the officers hakeswill spat his disgust at the answer officers are here to show us what we are fighting for gentlemen they are proper gentlemen men of property and breeding not broken potboys and scarletcoated pickpockets like what you are sergeants give the orders sergeants is what the army is remember that lads youre about to go into battle against heathens and if you ignore me then youll be dead men the face twitched grotesquely its jaw wrenched suddenly sideways and sharpe watching the sergeants face wondered if it was nervousness that had made hakeswill so voluble but keeps your eyes on me lads hakeswill went on and youll be right as trivets and you know why he cried the last word out in a high dramatic tone as he stalked down the light companys front rank you know why he asked again now sounding like some dissenting preacher ranting in a hedgerow because i cannot die boys i cannot die he was suddenly intense his voice hoarse and full of fervour as he spoke it was a speech that all the light company had heard many times before but it was remarkable for all that though sergeant green who was outranked by hakeswill turned away in disgust hakeswill jeered at green then tugged at the tight constriction of the leather stock that circled his neck pulling it down so that an old dark scar was visible at his throat the hangmans noose boys he cried thats what marked me there the hangmans noose see it see it but i am alive boys alive and on two feet instead of being buried under the sod proof as never was that you needs not die his face twitched again as he released the stock marked by god he finished his voice gruff with emotion thats what i am marked by god mad as a hare tom garrard muttered did you speak sharpie hakeswill whipped around to stare at sharpe but sharpe was so palpably still and staring mutely ahead that his innocence was indisputable hakeswill paced back down the light company i have watched men die better men than any of you pieces of scum proper men but god has spared me so you do what i says boys or else youll be carrion he abruptly thrust the musket back into sharpes hands clean weapon sharpie well done lad he paced smartly away and sharpe to his surprise saw that the scrap of rag had been neatly retied about the lock the compliment to sharpe had astonished all the light company hes in a rare good mood garrard said i heard that private garrard hakeswill shouted over his shoulder got ears in the back of me head i have silence now dont want no heathen horde thinking youre frit youre white men remember bleached in the cleansing blood of the bleeding lamb so no bleeding talking in the ranks nice and quiet like them bleeding nuns what never utters a sound on account of having had their papist tongues cut out he suddenly crashed to attention once again and saluted by bringing his speartipped halberd across his body company all present sir he shouted in a voice that must have been audible on the enemyheld ridge all present and quiet sir have their backs whipped bloody else sir lieutenant william lawford curbed his horse and nodded at sergeant hakeswill lawford was the light companys second officer junior to captain morris and senior to the brace of young ensigns but he was newly arrived in the battalion and was as frightened of hakeswill as were the men in the ranks the men can talk sergeant lawford observed mildly the other companies arent silent no sir must save their breath sir too bleeding hot to talk sir and besides they got heathens to kill sir mustnt waste breath on chitchat not when there are blackfaced heathens to kill sir says so in the scriptures sir if you say so sergeant lawford said unwilling to provoke a confrontation then he found he had nothing else to say and so awkwardly aware of the scrutiny of the light companys seventysix men he stared at the enemyheld ridge but he was also conscious of having ignominiously surrendered to the will of sergeant hakeswill and so he slowly coloured as he gazed towards the west lawford was popular but thought to be weak though sharpe was not so sure of that judgement he thought the lieutenant was still finding his way among the strange and sometimes frightening human currents that made up the rd and that in time lawford would prove a tough and resilient officer for now though william lawford was twentyfour years old and had only recently purchased his lieutenancy and that made him unsure of his authority ensign fitzgerald who was only eighteen strolled back from the columns head he was whistling as he walked and slashing with a drawn sabre at tall weeds off in a moment sir he called up cheerfully to lawford then seemed to become aware of the light companys ominous silence not frightened are you he asked saving their breath mister fitzgerald sir hakeswill snapped theyve got breath enough to sing a dozen songs and still beat the enemy fitzgerald said scornfully aint that so lads well beat the bastards sir tom garrard said then let me hear you sing fitzgerald demanded cant bear silence well have a quiet time in our tombs lads so we might as well make a noise now fitzgerald had a fine tenor voice that he used to start the song about the milkmaid and the rector and by the time the light company had reached the verse that told how the naked rector blindfolded by the milkmaid and thinking he was about to have his hearts desire was being steered towards bessie the cow the whole company was bawling the song enthusiastically they never did reach the end captain morris the light companys commanding officer rode back from the head of the battalion and interrupted the singing halfcompanies he shouted at hakeswill halfcompanies it is sir at once sir light company stop your bleeding noise you heard the officer hakeswill bellowed sergeant green take charge of the after ranks mister fitzgerald ill trouble you to take your proper place on the left sir forward ranks shoulder firelocks twenty paces forward march smartly now smartly hakeswills face shuddered as the front ten ranks of the company marched twenty paces and halted leaving the other nine ranks behind all along the battalion column the companies were similarly dividing their drill as crisp as though they were back on their yorkshire parade ground a quartermile off to the rds left another six battalions were going through the same manoeuvre and performing it with just as much precision those six battalions were all native soldiers in the service of the east india company though they wore red coats just like the kings men the six sepoy battalions shook out their colours and sharpe seeing the bright flags looked ahead to where the rds two great regimental banners were being loosed from their leather tubes to the fierce indian sun the first the kings colour was a british flag on which the regiments battle honours were embroidered while the second was the regimental colour and had the rds badge displayed on a scarlet field the same scarlet as the mens jacket facings the tasselled silk banners blazed and the sight of them prompted a sudden cannonade from the ridge till now there had only been the one heavy gun firing but abruptly six other cannon joined the fight the new guns were smaller and their round shot fell well short of the seven battalions major shee the irishman who commanded the rd while its colonel arthur wellesley had control of the whole brigade cantered his horse back spoke briefly to morris then wheeled away towards the head of the column were going to push the bastards off the ridge morris shouted at the light company then bent his head to light a cigar with a tinderbox any bastard that turns tail sergeant morris went on when his cigar was properly alight will be shot you hear me loud and clear sir hakeswill shouted shot sir shot like the coward he is he turned and scowled at the two halfcompanies shot and your names posted in your church porch at home as the cowards you are so fight like englishmen scotsmen a voice growled behind sharpe but too softly for hakeswill to hear irish another man said we aint none of us cowards garrard said more loudly sergeant green a decent man hushed him quiet lads i know youll do your duty the front of the column was marching now but the rearmost companies were kept waiting so that the battalion could advance with wide intervals between its twenty halfcompanies sharpe guessed that the scattered formation was intended to reduce any casualties caused by the enemys bombardment which because it was still being fired at extreme range was doing no damage behind him a long way behind the rest of the allied armies were waiting for the ridge to be cleared that mass looked like a formidable horde but sharpe knew that most of what he saw was the two armies civilian tail the chaos of merchants wives sutlers and herdsmen who kept the fighting soldiers alive and whose supplies would make the siege of the enemys capital possible it needed more than six thousand oxen just to carry the cannonballs for the big siege guns and all those oxen had to be herded and fed and the herdsmen all travelled with their families who in turn needed more oxen to carry their own supplies lieutenant lawford had once remarked that the expedition did not look like an army on the march but like a great migrating tribe the vast horde of civilians and animals was encircled by a thin crust of redcoated infantry most of them indian sepoys whose job was to protect the merchants ammunition and draught animals from the quickriding hardhitting light cavalry of the tippoo sultan the tippoo sultan the enemy the tyrant of mysore and the man who was presumably directing the gunfire on the ridge the tippoo ruled mysore and he was the enemy but what he was or why he was an enemy or whether he was a tyrant beast or demigod sharpe had no idea sharpe was here because he was a soldier and it was sufficient that he had been told that the tippoo sultan was his enemy and so he waited patiently under the indian sun that was soaking his lean tall body in sweat captain morris leaned on his saddles pommel he took off his cocked hat and wiped sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief that had been soaked in cologne water he had been drunk the previous night and his stomach was still churning with pain and wind if the battalion had not been going into battle he would have galloped away found a private spot and voided his bowels but he could hardly do that now in case his men thought it a sign of weakness and so he raised his canteen instead and swallowed some arrack in the hope that the harsh spirit would calm the turmoil in his belly now sergeant he called when the company in front had moved sufficiently far ahead forward halfcompany hakeswill shouted forward march smartly now lieutenant lawford given supervision of the last halfcompany of the battalion waited until hakeswills men had marched twenty paces then nodded at sergeant green forward sergeant the redcoats inarched with unloaded muskets for the enemy was still a long way off and there was no sign of the tippoo sultans infantry nor of his feared cavalry there were only the enemys guns and high in the fierce sky the circling vultures sharpe was in the leading rank of the final halfcompany and lieutenant lawford glancing at him thought once again what a finelooking man sharpe was there was a confidence in sharpes thin sundarkened face and hard blue eyes that spoke of an easy competence and that appearance was a comfort to a young nervous lieutenant advancing towards his first battle with men like sharpe lawford thought how could they lose sharpe was ignorant of the lieutenants glance and would have laughed had he been told that his very appearance inspired confidence sharpe had no conception of how he looked for he rarely saw a mirror and when he did the reflected image meant nothing though he did know that the ladies liked him and that he liked them he knew too that he was the tallest man in the light company so tall indeed that he should have been in the grenadier company that led the battalions advance but when he had first joined the regiment six years before the commanding officer of the light company had insisted on having sharpe in his ranks captain hughes was dead now killed by a bowelloosening flux in calcutta but in his time hughes had prided himself on having the quickest smartest men in his company men he could trust to fight alone in the skirmish line and it had been hughess tragedy that he had only ever seen his picked men face an enemy once and that once had been the misbegotten feverridden expedition to the foggy island off the coast of flanders where no amount of quickwittedness by the men could salvage success from the commanding generals stupidity now five years later on an indian field the rd again marched towards an enemy though instead of the enthusiastic and generous captain hughes the light corn pany was now commanded by captain morris who did not care how clever or quick his men were only that they gave him no trouble which was why he had brought sergeant hakeswill into the company and that was why the tall goodlooking hardeyed private called richard sharpe was thinking of running except he would not run today today there would be a fight and sharpe was happy at that prospect a fight meant plunder what the indian soldiers called loot and any man who was thinking of running and striking up life on his own could do with a bit of loot to prime the pump the seven battalions marched towards the ridge they were all in columns of halfcompanies so that from a vultures view they would have appeared as one hundred and forty small scarlet rectangles spread across a square mile of green country as they advanced steadily towards the waiting line of guns on the enemyheld ridge the sergeants paced beside the halfcompanies while the officers either rode or walked ahead from a distance the red squares looked smart for the mens red coats were bright scarlet and slashed with white crossbelts but in truth the troops were filthy and sweating their coats were wool designed for battlefields in flanders not india and the scarlet dye had run in the heavy rains so that the coats were now a pale pink or a dull purple and all were stained white with dried sweat every man in the rd wore a leather stock a cruel high collar that dug into the flesh of his neck and each mans long hair had been pulled harshly back greased with candle wax then twisted about a small sandfilled leather bag that was secured with a strip of black leather so that the hair hung like a club at the nape of the neck the hair was then powdered white with flour and though the clubbed and whitened hair looked smart and neat it was a haven for lice and fleas the native sepoys of the east india company were luckier they did not cake their hair with powder nor did they wear the heavy trousers of the british troops but instead marched barelegged they did not wear the leather stocks either and even more amazing there was no flogging in the indian battalions an enemy cannonball at last found a target and sharpe saw a halfcompany of the rd broken apart as the round shot whipped through the ranks he thought he glimpsed an instant red mist appear in the air above the formation as the ball slashed through but maybe that was an illusion two men stayed on the ground as a sergeant closed the ranks up two more men were limping and one of them staggered reeled and finally collapsed the drummer boys advancing just behind the unfurled colours marked the rhythm of the march with steady beats interspersed with quicker flourishes but when the boys marched past the twin heaps of offal that had been soldiers of the grenadier company a few seconds before they began to hurry their sticks and thus quickened the regiments pace until major shee turned in his saddle and damned their eagerness when are we going to load private mallinson asked sergeant green when youre told to lad when youre told to not before oh sweet jesus this last imprecation from sergeant green had been caused by a deafening ripple of gunfire from the ridge a dozen more of the tippoos smaller guns had opened fire and the crest of the ridge was now fogged by a greywhite cloud of smoke the two british galloper guns off to the right had unlimbered and started to return the fire but the enemy cannon were hidden by their own smoke and that thick screen obscured any damage the small galloper guns might be inflicting more cavalry trotted forward to the rds right these newcomers were indian troops dressed in scarlet turbans and holding long wickedpointed lances so what are we bleeding supposed to do mallinson complained just march straight up the bloody ridge with empty muskets if youre told to sergeant green said thats what youll do now hold your bloody tongue quiet back there hakeswill called from the halfcompany in front this aint a bleeding parish outing this is a fight you bastards sharpe wanted to be ready and so he untied the rag from his muskets lock and stuffed it into the pocket where he kept the ring mary had given him the ring a plain band of worn silver had belonged to sergeant bickerstaff marys husband but the sergeant was dead now and green had taken bickerstaffs sergeants stripes and sharpe his bed mary came from calcutta that was no place to run sharpe thought place was full of redcoats then he forgot any prospect of deserting for suddenly the landscape ahead was filling with enemy soldiers a mass of infantry was crossing the northern end of the low ridge and marching down onto the plain their uniforms were pale purple they had wide red hats and like the british indian troops were barelegged the flags above the marching men were red and yellow but the wind was so feeble that the flags hung straight down to obscure whatever device they might have shown more and more men appeared until sharpe could not even begin to estimate their numbers thirtythird a voice shouted from somewhere ahead line to the left line to the left captain morris echoed the shout you heard the officer sergeant hakeswill bawled line to the left smartly now on the double sergeant green called the leading halfcompany of the rd had halted and every other halfcompany angled to their left and sped their pace with the final halfcompany in which sharpe marched having the farthest and fastest to go the men began to jog their packs and pouches and bayonet scabbards bumping up and down as they stumbled over the small fields of crops like a swinging door the column that had been marching directly towards the ridge was now turning itself into a line that would lie parallel to the ridge and so bar the advance of the enemy infantry two files a voice shouted two files captain morris echoed you heard the officer hakeswill shouted two files on the right smartly now all the running halfcompanies now split themselves into two smaller units each of two ranks and each aligning itself on the unit to its right so that the whole battalion formed a fighting line two ranks deep as sharpe ran into position he glanced to his right and saw the drummer boys taking their place behind the regiments colours which were guarded by a squad of sergeants armed with long axeheaded poles the light company was the last into position there were a few seconds of shuffling as the men glanced right to check their alignment then there was stillness and silence except for the corporals fussily closing up the files in less than a minute in a marvellous display of drill the rings rd had deployed from column of march into line of battle so that seven hundred men arrayed in two long ranks now faced the enemy you may load major shee that was colonel wellesleys voice he had galloped his horse close to where major shee brooded under the regiments twin flags the six indian battalions were still hurrying forward on the left but the enemy infantry had appeared at the northern end of the ridge and that meant the rd was the nearest unit and the one most likely to receive the tippoos assault load captain morris shouted at hakeswill sharpe felt suddenly nervous as he dropped the musket from his shoulder to hold it across his body he fumbled with the muskets hammer as he pulled it back to the half cock sweat stung his eyes he could hear the enemy drummers handle cartridge sergeant hakeswill shouted and each man of the light company pulled a cartridge from his belt pouch and bit through the tough waxed paper they held the bullets in their mourns tasting the sour salty gunpowder prime seventysix men trickled a small pinch of powder from the opened cartridges into their muskets pans then closed the locks so that the priming was trapped cast about hakeswill called and seventysix right hands released their musket stocks so that the weapons butts dropped towards the ground and im watching you hakeswill added if any of you lilywhite bastards dont use all his powder ill skin your hides off you and rub salt on your miserable flesh do it proper now some old soldiers advised only using half the powder of a cartridge letting the rest trickle to the ground so that the muskets brutal kick would be diminished but faced by an advancing enemy no man thought of employing that trick this day they poured the remainder of their cartridges powder down their musket barrels stuffed the cartridge paper after the powder then took the balls from their mouths and pushed them into the muzzles the enemy infantry was two hundred yards away and advancing steadily to the beat of drums and the blare of trumpets the tippoos guns were still firing but they had turned their barrels away from the rd for fear of hitting their own infantry and were instead aiming at the six indian regiments that were hurrying to close the gap between themselves and the rd draw ramrod hakeswill shouted and sharpe tugged the ramrod free of the three brass pipes that held it under the muskets thirtynineinch barrel his mouth was salty with the taste of gunpowder he was still nervous not because the enemy was tramping ever closer but because he had a sudden idiotic idea that he might have forgotten how to load a musket he twisted the ramrod in the air then placed the ramrods flared tip into the barrel ram cartridge hakeswill snapped seventysix men thrust down forcing the ball wadding and powder charge to the bottom of the barrels return ramrod sharpe tugged the ramrod up listening to it scrape against the barrel then twirled it about so that its narrow end would slide down into the brass pipes he let it drop into place order arms captain morris called and the light company now with loaded muskets stood to attention with their guns held against their right sides the enemy was still too far off for a musket to be either accurate or lethal and the long twodeep line of seven hundred redcoats would wait until their opening volley could do real damage talion sergeant major bywaterss voice called from the centre of the line fix bayonets sharpe dragged the seventeeninch blade from its sheatii which hung behind his right hip he slotted the blade over the muskets muzzle then locked it in place by twisting its slot onto the lug now no enemy could pull the bayonet off the musket having the blade mounted made reloading the musket far more difficult but sharpe guessed that colonel wellesley had decided to shoot one volley and then charge going to be a right mucky brawl he said to tom garrard more of them than us garrard muttered staring at the enemy the buggers look steady enough the enemy indeed looked steady the leading troops had momentarily paused to allow the men behind to catch up but now reformed into a solid column they were readying to advance again their ranks and files were ramrod straight their officers wore waist sashes and carried highly curved sabres one of the flags was being waved to and fro and sharpe could just make out that it showed a golden sun blazoned against a scarlet sky vultures swooped lower the galloper guns unable to resist the target of the great column of infantry poured solid shot into its flank but the tippoos men stoically endured the punishment as their officers made certain that the column was tight packed and ready to deliver its crushing blow on the waiting redcoat line sharpe licked his dry lips so these he thought were the tippoos men finelooking bastards they were too and close enough now so that he could see that their tunics were not plain pale purple but were instead cut from a creamywhite cloth decorated with mauve tiger stripes their crossbelts were black and their turbans and waist sashes crimson heathens they might be but not to be despised for that for only seventeen years before these same tigerstriped men had torn apart a british army and forced its survivors to surrender these were the famed tiger troops of mysore the warriors of the tippoo sultan who had dominated all of southern india until the british thought to climb the ghats from the coastal plain and plunge into mysore itself the french were these mens allies and some frenchmen served in the tippoos forces but sharpe could see no white faces in the massive column that at last was ready and to the deep beat of a single drum lurched ponderously forward the tigerstriped troops were marching directly towards the kings rd and sharpe glancing to his left saw that the sepoys of the east india company regiments were still too far away to offer help the rd would have to deal with the tippoos column alone private sharpe hakeswills sudden scream was loud enough to drown the cheer that the tippoos troops gave as they advanced private sharpe hakeswill screamed again he was hurrying along the back of the light company and captain morris momentarily dismounted was following him give me your musket private sharpe hakeswill bellowed nothing wrong with it sharpe protested he was in the front rank and had to turn and push his way between garrard and mallinson to hand the gun over hakeswill snatched the musket and gleefully presented it to captain morris see sir the sergeant crowed just as i thought sir bastard sold his flint sir sold it to an eathen darkie hakeswills face twitched as he gave sharpe a triumphant glance the sergeant had unscrewed the muskets doghead extracted the flint in its folded leather pad and now offered the scrap of stone to captain morris piece of common rock sir no good to man or beast must have flogged his flint sir flogged it in exchange for a pagan whore sir i dare say filthy beast that he is morris peered at the flint sell the flint did you private he asked in a voice that mingled derision pleasure and bitterness no sir silence hakeswill screamed into sharpes face spattering him with spittle lying to an officer flogging offence sir flogging offence selling his flint sir another flogging offence sir says so in the scriptures sir it is a flogging offence morris said with a tone of satisfaction he was as tall and lean as sharpe with fair hair and a fineboned face that was just beginning to show the ravages of the liquor with which the captain assuaged his boredom his eyes betrayed his cynicism and something much worse that he despised his men hakeswill and morris sharpe thought as he watched them a right bloody pair nothing wrong with that flint sir sharpe insisted morris held the flint in the palm of his right hand looks like a chip of stone to me common grit sir hakeswill said common bloody grit sir no good to man or beast might i a new voice spoke lieutenant william lawford had dismounted to join morris and now without waiting for his captains permission he reached over and took the flint from morriss hand lawford was blushing again astonished by his own temerity in thus intervening theres an easy way to check sir lawford said nervously then he drew out his pistol cocked it and struck the loose flint against the pistols steel even in the days bright sunlight there was an obvious spark seems like a good flint to me sir lawford said mildly ensign fitzgerald standing behind lawford gave sharpe a conspiratorial grin a perfectly good flint lawford insisted less diffidently morris gave hakeswill a furious look then turned on his heel and strode back towards his horse lawford tossed the flint to sharpe make your gun ready sharpe he said yes sir thank you sir lawford and fitzgerald walked away as hakeswill humiliated thrust the musket back at sharpe clever bastard sharpie arent you iii have the leather as well sergeant sharpe said and once he had the flints seating back he called after hakeswill who had begun to walk away sergeant hakeswill turned back you want this sergeant sharpe called he took a chip of stone out of his pocket he had found it when he had untied the rag from the muskets lock and realized that hakeswill had substituted the stone for the flint when he had pretended to inspect sharpes musket no use to me sergeant sharpe said here he tossed the stone at hakeswill who ignored it instead the sergeant spat and turned away thanks tom sharpe said for it had been garrard who had supplied him with a spare flint worth being in the army to see that garrard said and all around him men laughed to have seen hakeswill and morris defeated eyes to your front lads ensign fitzgerald called the irish ensign was the youngest officer in the company but he had the confidence of a much older man got some shooting to do sharpe pushed back into his file he brought up the musket folded the leather over the flint and seated it in the doghead men looked up to see that the mass of the enemy was now just a hundred paces away they were shouting rhythmically and pausing occasionally to let a trumpet sound or a drum flourish a ripple but the loudest sound was the beat of their feet on the dry earth sharpe tried to count the columns front rank but kept losing count as enemy officers marched slantwise across the columns face there had to be thousands of the tiger troops all marching like a great sledgehammer to shatter the twodeep line of redcoats cutting it fine arent we a man complained wait lads wait sergeant green said calmly the enemy now filled the landscape ahead they came in a column formed of sixty ranks of fifty men three thousand in all though to sharpes inexperienced eye it seemed as if there must be ten times that number none of the tippoos men fired as they advanced but held their fire just as the rd were holding theirs the enemys muskets were tipped with bayonets while their officers were holding deeply curved sabres on they came and to sharpe who was watching the column from the left of the line so that he could see its flank as well as its leading file the enemy formation seemed as unstoppable as a heavily loaded farm wagon that was rolling slowly and inexorably towards a flimsy fence he could see the enemys faces now they were dark with black moustaches and oddly white teeth the tiger men were close so close and their chanting began to dissolve into individual war shouts any second now sharpe thought and the heavy column would break into a run and charge with levelled bayonets thirtythird colonel wellesleys voice called out sharply from beneath the regiments colours make ready sharpe put his right foot behind his left so that his body half turned to the right then he brought his musket to hip height and pulled the hammer back to full cock it clicked solidly into place and somehow the pentup pressure of the guns mainspring was reassuring to the approaching enemy it seemed as though the whole british line had half turned and the sudden movement coming from men who had been waiting so silently momentarily checked their eagerness above the tiger troops of mysore beneath a bunch of flags on the ridge where the guns fired a group of horsemen watched the column was the tippoo himself there sharpe wondered and was the tippoo dreaming of that faroff day when he had broken three and half thousand british and indian troops and marched them off to captivity in his capital at seringapatam the cheers of the attackers were filling the sky now but still colonel wellesleys voice was audible over the tumult present seven hundred muskets came up to seven hundred shoulders the muskets were tipped with steel seven hundred muskets aimed at the head of the column and about to blast seven hundred ounces of lead at the leading ranks of that fastmoving confident mass that was plunging straight towards the pair of british colours under which colonel arthur wellesley waited the tiger men were hurrying now their front rank breaking apart as they began running the wagon was about to hit the fence arthur wellesley had waited six years for this moment he was twentynine years old and had begun to fear that he would never see battle but now at last he would discover whether he and his regiment could fight and so he filled his lungs to give the order that would start the slaughter colonel jean gudin sighed then for the thousandth time in the last hour he fanned his face to drive away the flies he liked india but he hated flies which made india quite hard to like but on balance despite the flies he did like india not nearly as much as he liked his native provence but where on earth was as lovely as provence your majesty he ventured diffidently then waited as his interpreter struggled to gain the tippoos attention the interpreter was exchanging gudins french for the tippoos persian tongue the tippoo did understand some french and he spoke the local kanarese language well enough but he preferred persian for it reminded him that his lineage went back to the great persian dynasties the tippoo was ever mindful that he was superior to the darkerskinned natives of mysore he was a muslim he was a persian and he was a ruler while they were mostly hindus and all of them whether rich poor great or lowly were his obedient subjects your majesty colonel gudin tried again colonel the tippoo was a short man inclined to plumpness with a moustached face wide eyes and a prominent nose he was not an impressivelooking man but gudin knew the tippoos unprepossessing appearance disguised a decisive mind and a brave heart although the tippoo acknowledged gudin he did not turn to look at the colonel instead he leaned forward in his saddle with one hand clasped over the tiger hilt of his curved sabre as he watched his infantry march on the infidel british the sword was slung on a silken sash that crossed the pale yellow silk jacket that the tippoo wore above chintz trousers his turban was of red silk and pinned with a gold badge showing a tigers mask the tippoos every possible accoutrement was decorated with the tiger for the tiger was his mascot and inspiration but the badge on his turban also incorporated his reverence for allah for the tigers snarling face was formed by a cunning cipher that spelled out a verse of the koran the lion of god is the conqueror above it pinned to the turbans brief white plume and brilliant in the days sunlight there glittered a ruby the size of a pigeons egg colonel the tippoo said again it might be wise your majesty gudin suggested hesitantly if we advanced cannon and cavalry onto the british flank gudin gestured to where the rd waited in its thin red line to receive the charge of the tippoos column if the tippoo threatened a flank of that fragile line with cavalry then the british regiment would be forced to shrink into square and thus deny three quarters of their muskets a chance to fire at the column the tippoo shook his head we shall sweep that scum away with our infantry gudin then send the cavalry against the baggage he let go of his swords hilt to touch his fingers fleetingly together please allah and if it does not please allah gudin asked and suspected that his interpreter would change the insolence of the question into something more acceptable to the tippoo then we shall fight them from the walls of seringapatam the tippoo answered and turned briefly from watching the imminent battle to offer colonel gudin a quick smile it was not a friendly smile but a feral grimace of anticipation we shall destroy them with cannon colonel the tippoo continued with relish and shatter them with rockets and in a few weeks the monsoon will drown their survivors and after that if allah pleases we shall hunt fugitive englishmen from here to the sea if allah pleases gudin said resignedly officially he was an adviser to the tippoo sent by the directorate in paris to help mysore defeat the british and the patient gudin had just done his best to give advice and it was none of his fault if the advice was spurned he brushed flies from his face then watched as the rd brought their muskets to their shoulders when those muskets flamed the frenchman thought the front of the tippoos column would crumple like a honeycomb hit by a hammer but at least the slaughter would teach the tippoo that battles could not be won against disciplined troops unless every weapon was used against them cavalry to force them to bunch up in protection then artillery and infantry to pour fire into the massed ranks the tippoo surely knew that yet he had insisted on throwing his three thousand infantry forward without cavalry support and gudin could only suppose that either the tippoo believed allah would be fighting on his side this afternoon or else he was so consumed by his famous victory over the british seventeen years before that he believed he could always beat them in open conflict gudin slapped at flies again it was time he thought to go home much as he liked india he felt frustrated he suspected that the government in paris had forgotten about his existence and he was keenly aware that the tippoo was not receptive to his advice he did not blame the tippoo paris had made so many promises but no french army had come to fight for mysore and gudin sensed the tippoos disappointment and even sympathized with it while gudin himself felt useless and abandoned some of his contemporaries were already generals even little bonaparte a corsican whom gudin had known slightly in toulon now had an army of his own while jean gudin was stranded in distant mysore which made victory all the more important and if the british were not broken here then they would have to be beaten by the massed artillery and rockets that waited on seringapatams walls that was also where gudins small battalion of european soldiers was waiting and seringapatam he suspected was where this campaign would be decided and if there was victory and if the british were thrown out of southern india then gudins reward would surely be back in france back home where the flies did not swarm like mice the enemy regiment waited with levelled muskets the tippoos men cheered and charged impetuously onwards the tippoo leaned forward unconsciously biting his lower lip as he waited for the impact gudin wondered whether his woman in seringapatam would like provence or whether provence would like her or maybe it was time for a new woman he sighed slapped at flies then involuntarily shuddered for beneath him the killing had begun fire colonel wellesley shouted seven hundred men pulled their triggers and seven hundred flints snapped forward onto frizzens the sparks ignited the powder in the pans there was a pause as the fire fizzed through the seven hundred touchholes then an almighty crackling roar as the heavy muskets flamed the brass butt of the gun slammed into sharpes shoulder he had aimed the weapon at a sashed officer leading the enemy column though even at sixty yards range it was hardly worth aiming a musket for it was a frighteningly inaccurate weapon but unless the ball flew high it ought to hit someone he could not tell what damage the volley had caused for the instant the musket banged into his shoulder his vision was obscured by the filmy bank of rolling smoke coughed out of the seven hundred musket muzzles he could hardly hear anything either for the sound of the rear rank muskets going off close beside his head had left his ears ringing his right hand automatically went to find a new cartridge from his pouch but then above the ringing in his ears he heard the colonels brusque voice forward thirtythird forward go on boys sergeant green called steady now dont run walk damn your eagerness ensign fitzgerald shouted at the company hold your ranks this aint a race the regiment marched into the musket smoke which stank like rotting eggs lieutenant lawford suddenly remembered to draw his sword he could see nothing beyond the smoke but imagined a terrible enemy waiting with raised muskets he touched the pocket of his coat in which he kept the bible given to him by his mother the front rank advanced clear of the stinking smoke fog and suddenly there was nodiing ahead but chaos and carnage the seven hundred lead balls had converged on the front of the column to strike home with a brutal efficiency where there had been orderly ranks there were now only dead men and dying men who writhed on the ground the rearward ranks of the enemy could not advance over the barrier of the dead and injured so they stood uncertainly as out of the smoke the seven hundred bayonets appeared on the double on the double dont let them stand colonel wellesley called give them a cheer boys sergeant green called go for them now kill the buggers sharpe had no thought of deserting now for now he was about to fight if there was any one good reason to join the army it was to fight not to hurry up and do nothing but to fight the kings enemies and this enemy had been shocked by the awful violence of the closerange volley and now they stared in horror as the redcoats screamed and ran towards them the rd released from the tight discipline of the ranks charged eagerly there was loot ahead loot and food and stunned men to slaughter and there were few men in the rd who did not like a good fight not many had joined the ranks out of patriotism instead like sharpe they had taken the kings shilling because hunger or desperation had forced them into uniform but they were still good soldiers they came from the gutters of britain where a man survived by savagery rather than by cleverness they were brawlers and bastards alleyfighters with nothing to lose but tuppence a day sharpe howled as he ran the sepoy battalions were closing up on the left but there was no need for their musketry now for the tippoos vaunted tiger infantry were not staying to contest the afternoon they were edging backwards looking for escape and then out of the north where they had been half hidden by the redblossomed trees the british and indian cavalry charged to the sound of a trumpets call lances were lowered and sabres held like spears as the horsemen thundered onto the enemys flank the tippoos infantry fled a few the lucky few scrambled back up the ridge but most were caught in the open ground between the rd and the ridges slope and there the killing became a massacre sharpe reached the pile of dead and leapt over them just beyond the bloody pile a wounded man tried to bring up his musket but sharpe slammed the butt of his gun onto the mans head kicked the musket out of his enfeebled hands and ran on he was aiming for an officer a brave man who had tried to rally his troops and who now hesitated fatally the man was carrying a drawn sabre then he remembered the pistol in his belt and fumbled to draw it but saw he was too late and turned to run after his men sharpe was faster he rammed his bayonet forward and struck the indian officer on the side of the neck the man turned his sabre whistling as he sliced the curved blade at sharpes head sharpe parried the blow with the barrel of his musket a sliver of wood was slashed off the stock as sharpe kicked the officer between the legs sharpe was screaming a challenge a scream of hate mat had nothing to do with mysore or me enemy officer and everydiing to do with the frustrations of his life the indian staggered hunched over and sharpe slammed the muskets heavy butt into the dark face the enemy officer went down his sabre falling from his hand he shouted something maybe offering his surrender but sharpe did not care he just put his left foot on the mans sword arm men drove the bayonet hard down into his throat the fight might have lasted diree seconds sharpe advanced no farther orner men ran past screaming as they pursued the fleeing enemy but sharpe had found his victim he had thrust the bayonet so hard that the blade had gone clean through the officers neck into the soil beneath and it was hard work to pull the steel free and in the end he had to put a boot on the dying mans forehead before he could tug the bayonet out blood gushed from the wound men subsided to a throbbing pulse of spilling red as sharpe knelt and began rifling the mans gaudy uniform oblivious of the choking bubbling sound that the officer was making as he died sharpe ripped off the yellow silk sash and tossed it aside together with the silverhilled sabre and the pistol the sabre scabbard was made of boiled leather nothing of any value to sharpe but behind it was a small embroidered pouch and sharpe drew out his knife unfolded the blade and slashed through the pouchs straps he fumbled the pouch open to find that it was filled with nothing but dry rice and one small scrap of what looked like cake he smelt it gingerly and guessed it was made of some kind of bean he tossed the food aside and spat a curse at the dying man wheres your bleeding money the man gasped made a choking sound then his whole body jerked as his heart finally gave up the struggle sharpe tore at the tunic that was decorated with mauve tiger stripes he felt the seams looking for coins found none so pulled off the wide red turban that was sticky with fresh blood the dead mans face was already crawling with flies sharpe pulled the turban apart and there in the very centre of the greasy cloth he found three silver and a dozen small copper coins knew youd have something he told the dead man then pushed the coins into his own pouch the cavalry was finishing off the remnants of the tippoos infantry the tippoo himself with his entourage and standardbearers had gone from the top of the ridge and there were no cannon firing there either the enemy had slipped away abandoning their trapped infantry to the sabres and lances of the british and indian cavalry the indian cavalry had been recruited from the city of madras and the east coast states which had all suffered from the tippoos raids and now they took a bloody revenge whooping and laughing as their blades cut down the terrified fugitives some cavalrymen running out of targets were already dismounted and searching the dead for plunder the sepoy infantry too late to join the killing arrived to join the plunder sharpe twisted the bayonet off his musket wiped it clean on the dead mans sash scooped up the sabre and pistol then went to find more loot he was grinning and thinking that there was nothing to this fighting business nothing at all a few shots in flanders one volley here and neither fight was worthy of the name battle flanders had been a muddle and this fight had been as easy as slaughtering sheep no wonder sergeant hakeswill would live for ever and so would he sharpe reckoned because there was nothing to this business just a couple of bangs and it was all over he laughed slid the bayonet into its sheath and knelt beside another dead man there was work to do and a future to finance if only he could decide where it would be safe to run chapter sergeant obadiah hakeswill glanced about to see what his men were doing just about all of them were plundering and quite right too that was a soldiers privilege fight the battle then strip the enemy of anything worth a penny the officers were not looting but officers never did at least not so that anyone noticed them but hakeswill did see that ensign fitzgerald had somehow managed to get himself a jewelled sabre that he was now flashing around like a shilling whore given a guinea fan mister bloody ensign fitzgerald was getting above himself in sergeant hakeswills considered opinion ensigns were the lowest of the low apprentice officers lads in silver lace and mister bloody fitzgerald had no business countermanding hakeswills orders so mister bloody fitzgerald must be taught his place but the trouble was that mister fitzgerald was irish and hakeswill was of the opinion that the irish were only half civilized and never did understand their place most of them anyway major shee was irish and he was civilized at least when he was sober and colonel wellesley who was from dublin was wholly civilized but the colonel had possessed the sense to make himself more english than the english while mister bloody fitzgerald made no pretence about his birth see this hakeswill fitzgerald sublimely unaware of hakeswills glowering thoughts stepped across a body to show off his new sabre see what sir damned blade is made in birmingham will you credit that birmingham says so on the blade see made in birmingham hakeswill dutifully examined the legend on the blade then fingered the sabres pommel which was elegantly set with a ring of seven small rubies looks like glass to me sir he said dismissively hoping he could somehow persuade fitzgerald to relinquish the blade nonsense fitzgerald said cheerfully best rubies bit small maybe but i doubt the ladies will mind that seven pieces of glitter that adds up to a week of sin sergeant it was worth killing the rascal for that if you did kill him hakeswill thought sourly as he stumped away from the exuberant ensign more likely picked it up off the ground and fitzgerald was right seven rubies even small ones would buy a lot of naigs ladies nasty naig was a merchant from madras one of the many travelling with the army and he had brought his brothel with him it was an expensive brothel officers only or at least only those who could pay an officers price and that made hakeswill think of mary bickerstaff mrs mary bickerstaff she was a half and half half indian and half british and that made her valuable very valuable most of the women who followed the army were dark as hades and while obadiah hakeswill had no distaste for dark skin he did miss the touch of white flesh so did many of the officers and there was a guinea or two to be made out of that lust naig would pay well for a skin as pale as mary bickerstaffs she was a rare beauty mary bickerstaff a beauty amongst a pack of ugly rancid women hakeswill watched as a group of the battalions wives ran to take part in the plundering and almost shuddered as he contemplated their ugliness about two thirds of the wives were bibbis indians and most of those hakeswill knew were not properly married with the colonels permission while the rest were those lucky british women who had won the brutal lottery that had taken place on the night before the battalion had sailed from england the wives had been gathered in a barrack room their names had been put into ten shakos one for each company and the first ten names drawn from each hat were allowed to accompany their husbands the rest had to stay in britain and what happened to them there was anybodys guess most went on the parish but parishes resented feeding soldiers wives so as eke as not they were forced to become whores barrackgate whores for the most part because they lacked the looks for anything better but a few a precious few were pretty and none was prettier than sergeant bickerstaffs half and half widow the women spread out among the dead and dying mysoreans if anything they were even more efficient than their men at plundering the dead for the men tended to hurry and so missed the hiding places where a soldier secreted his money hakeswill watched flora placket strip me body of a tall tigerstriped corpse whose throat had been slashed to the backbone by the slice of a cavalrymans sabre she did not rush her work but searched carefully garment by garment then handed each piece of clothing to one of her two children to fold and stack hakeswill approved of flora placket for she was a large and steady woman who kept her man in good order and made no fuss about a campaigns discomforts she was a good mother too and that was why obadiah did not care that flora placket was as ugly as a haversack mothers were sacred mothers were not expected to be pretty mothers were obadiah hakeswills guardian angels and flora placket reminded obadiah of his own mother who was the only person in all his life who had shown him kindness biddy hakeswill was long dead now she had died a year before the twelveyearold obadiah had dangled on a scaffold for the trumpedup charge of sheep stealing and to amuse the crowd the executioner had not let any of that days victims drop from the gallows but had instead hoisted them gently into the air so that they choked slowly as their pisssoaked legs jerked in the death dance of the gibbet no one had taken much notice of the small boy at the scaffolds end and when the heavens had opened and the rain come down in bucketfuls to scatter the crowd no one had bothered when biddy hakeswills brother had cut the boy down and set him loose did it for your mother his uncle had snarled god rest her soul now be off with you and dont ever show your face in the dale again hakeswill had run south joined the army as a drummer boy had risen to sergeant and had never forgotten his dying mothers words no one will ever get rid of obadiah she had said not my obadiah deaths too good for him the gallows had proved that touched by god he was indestructible a groan sounded near hakeswill and the sergeant snapped out of his reverie to see a tigerstriped indian struggling to turn onto his belly hakeswill scurried over forced the man onto his back again and placed his halberds spear point at the mans throat money hakeswill snarled then held out his left hand and motioned the counting of coins money the man blinked slowly then said something in his own language iii let you live you bugger hakeswill promised leering at the wounded man not that youll live long got a goolie in your belly see he pointed at the wound in the mans belly where the bullet had driven home now wheres your money money pice dan pagodas annas rupees the man must have understood for his hand fluttered weakly towards his chest good boy now hakeswill said smiling again then his face jerked in its involuntary spasms as he pushed the spear point home but not too quickly for he liked to see the realization of death on a mans face youre a stupid bugger too hakeswill said when the mans death throes had ended then he cut open the tunic and found that the man had strapped some coins to his chest with a cotton sash he undid the sash and pocketed the handful of copper change not a big haul but hakeswill was not dependent on his own plundering to fill his purse he would take a cut from whatever the soldiers of the light company found they knew they would have to pay up or else face punishment he saw sharpe kneeling beside a body and hurried across got a sword there sharpie hakeswill asked stole it did you i killed the man sergeant sharpe looked up doesnt bleeding matter does it lad you aint permitted to carry a sword officers weapon a sword is mustnt get above your station sharpie get above yourself boy and youll be cut down so ill take the blade i will hakeswill half expected sharpe to resist but the private did nothing as the sergeant picked up the silverhilled blade worth a few bob i dare say hakeswill said appreciatively then he laid the swords tip against the stock at sharpes neck which is more than youre worth sharpie too clever for your own good you are sharpe edged away from the sword and stood up i aint got a quarrel with you sergeant he said but you do boy you do hakeswill grimaced as his face went into spasm and you know what the quarrels about dont you sharpe backed away from the sword t aint got a quarrel with you he repeated stubbornly i think our quarrel is called mrs bickerstaff hakeswill said and grinned when sharpe said nothing i almost got you with that flint didnt i would have had you flogged raw boy and youd have died of a fever within a week a flogging does that in this climate wears a man down a flogging does but you got a friendly officer dont you mister lawford he likes you does he he prodded sharpes chest with the swords tip is that what it is officers pet are you mister lawford aint nothing to me sharpe said thats what you say but my eyes tell different hakeswill giggled sweet on each other are you you and mister lawford aint that nice sharpie but it dont make you much use to mrs bickerstaff does it reckon shed be better off with a real man she aint your business sharpe said aint my business oh listen to it hakeswill sneered then prodded the sword forward again he wanted to provoke sharpe into resisting for then he could charge him with attacking a superior but the tall young man just backed away from the blade you listen sharpie hakeswill said and you listen well shes a sergeants wife not the whore of some common ranker like you sergeant bickerstaffs dead sharpe protested so she needs a man hakeswill said and a sergeants widow doesnt get rogered by a stinking bit of dirt like you it aint right aint natural its beneath her station sharpie and it cant be allowed says so in the scriptures she can choose who she wants sharpe insisted choose sharpie choose hakeswill laughed women dont choose you soft bugger women get taken by the strongest says so in the scriptures and if you stand in my way sharpie he pushed the sword hard forward then ill have your spine laid open to the daylight a lost flint that would have been two hundred lashes lad but next time a thousand and laid on hard real hard be blood and bones boy bones and blood and wholl look after your mrs bickerstaff then eh tell me that so you takes your filthy hands off her leave her to me sharpie he leered at sharpe but still the younger man refused to be provoked and hakeswill at last abandoned the attempt worth a few guineas this sword the sergeant said again as he backed away obliged to you sharpie sharpe swore uselessly at hakeswills back then turned as a woman hailed him from among the heaped bodies that had been the leading ranks of the tippoos column those bodies were now being dragged apart to be searched and mary bickerstaff was helping the work along he walked towards her and as ever was struck by the beauty of the girl she had black hair a thin face and dark big eyes that could spark with mischief now though she looked worried what did hakeswill want she asked you she spat then crouched again to the body she was searching he cant touch you richard she said not if you do your duty the armys not like that and you know it youve just got to be clever mary insisted she was a soldiers daughter who had grown up in the calcutta barrack lines she had inherited her dark indian beauty from her mother and learned the ways of soldiers from her father who had been an engineer sergeant in the old forts garrison before an outbreak of cholera had killed him and his native wife marys father had always claimed she was pretty enough to many an officer and so rise in the world but no officer would marry a halfcaste at least no officer who cared about advancement and so after her parents death mary had married sergeant jem bickerstaff of the rd a good man but bickerstaff had died of the fever shortly after the army had left madras to climb to the mysore plateau and mary at twentytwo was now an orphan and a widow she was also wise to the armys ways if youre made up to sergeant richard she told sharpe now then hakeswill cant touch you sharpe laughed me a sergeant thatll be the day lass i made corporal once but that didnt last you can be a sergeant she insisted and you should be a sergeant and hakeswill couldnt touch you if you were sharpe shrugged it aint me he wants to touch lass but you mary had been cutting a tigerstriped tunic from a dead man but now she paused and looked quizzically up at sharpe she had not been in love with jem bickerstaff but she had recognized that the sergeant was a good kind man and she saw the same decency in sharpe it was not exactly the same decency for sharpe she reckoned had ten times jem bickerstaffs fire and he could be as cunning as a snake when it suited him but mary still trusted sharpe she was also attracted to him there was something very striking about sharpes lean good looks something dangerous she acknowledged but very exciting she looked at him for a few seconds then shrugged maybe he wont dare touch me if were married she said i mean proper married with the colonels permission married sharpe said flustered by the word mary stood tt aint easy being a widow in the army richard every man reckons youre loot aye i know its hard sharpe said frowning he stared at her as he thought about the idea of getting married till now he had only been thinking of desertion but maybe marriage was not such a bad idea at least it would make it much harder for hakeswill to get his hands on marys skin and a married man sharpe reckoned was more likely to be promoted but what was the point of rising an inch or two in the dunghill even a sergeant was still at the bottom of the heap it was better to be out of the army altogether and mary sharpe decided would be more likely to desert with him if she was properly married to him that thought made him nod slowly i reckon i might like to be married he said shyly me too she smiled and awkwardly sharpe smiled back for a moment neither had anything to say then mary excitedly fished in the pocket of her apron to produce a jewel she had taken from a dead man look what i found she handed sharpe a red stone half the size of a hens egg you reckon its a ruby mary asked eagerly sharpe tossed the stone up and down i reckon its glass lass he said gently just glass but ill get you a ruby for a wedding gift just you watch me iil more than watch you dick sharpe she said happily and put her arm into his sergeant hakeswill a hundred paces away watched them and his face twitched while on the edges of the killing place where the looted and naked bodies lay scattered the vultures came down sidled forward and began to tear at the dead the allied armies camped a quarter of a mile short of the place where the dead lay the camp sprawled across the plain an instant town where fifty thousand soldiers and thousands of camp followers would spend the night tents went up for officers well away from the places where the vast herds of cattle were guarded for the night some of the cattle were beeves being herded and slaughtered for food some were oxen that carried panniers filled with the eighteen and twentyfourpounder cannonballs that would be needed to blast a hole through the walls of seringapatam while yet others were bullocks that hauled the wagons and guns and the heaviest guns the big siege pieces needed sixty bullocks apiece there were more than two hundred thousand cattle with the army but all were now scrawny for the tippoos cavalry was stripping the land of fodder as the british and hyderabad armies advanced the common soldiers had no tents they would sleep on the ground close to their fires but first they ate and this night the feeding was good at least for the men of the kings rd who had coins taken from the enemy dead to spend with the bhityarries the merchant clans that travelled with the army and had their own private guards to protect their goods the bhinjarries all sold chickens rice flour beans and best of all the throatburning skins of arrack which could make a man drunk even faster than rum some of the bhinjarms also hired out whores and the rd gave those men good business that night captain morris expected to visit the famous green tents of naig the bhinjanie whose stock in trade was the most expensive whores of madras but for now he was stuck in his own tent where under the feeble light of a candle that flickered on his table he disposed of the companys business or rather sergeant hakeswill disposed of it while morris his coat unbuttoned and silk stock loosened sprawled in a camp chair sweat dripped down his face there was a small wind but the muslin screen hanging at the entrance to the tent took away its cooling effects and if the screen was discarded the tent would fill with savagely huge moths morris hated moths hated the heat hated india guard rosters sir hakeswill said offering the papers anything i should know not a thing sir just like last weeks sir ensign hicks made up the roster sir a good man sir ensign hicks knows his place you mean he does what you tell him to do morris asked drily learning his trade sir learning his trade just like a good little ensign should unlike some as i could mention morris ignored the sly reference to fitzgerald and instead dipped his quill in ink and scrawled his name at the foot of the rosters i assume ensign fitzgerald and sergeant green have been assigned all the night duty he asked they needs the practice sir and you need your sleep sergeant punishment book sir hakeswill said offering the leatherbound ledger and taking back the guard roster without acknowledging morriss last comment morris leafed through the book no floggings this week will be soon sir will be soon private sharpe escaped you today eh morris laughed losing your touch obadiah there was no friendliness in his use of the christian name just scorn but sergeant hakeswill took no offence officers were officers at least those above ensigns were proper officers in hakeswills opinion and such gentlemen had every right to be scornful of lesser ranks i aint losing nothing sir hakeswill answered equably if the rat dont die first shake sir then you puts the dog in again thats how its done sir says so in the scriptures sick report sir nothing new except that sears has the fever so he wont be with us long but he wont be no loss sir no good to man or beast private sears better off dead he is are we done morris asked when he had signed the sick report but then a tactful cough sounded at the tents opening and lieutenant lawford ducked under the flap and pushed through the muslin screen busy charles lawford asked morris always pleased to see you william morris said sarcastically but i was about to go for a stroll theres a soldier to see you lawford explained mans got a request sir morris sighed as though he was too busy to be bothered with such trifles but then he shrugged and waved a hand as if to suggest he was making a great and generous gesture by giving the man a moment of his precious time who he asked private sharpe sir troublemaker sir hakeswill put in hes a good man lawford insisted hotly but then decided his small experience of the army hardly qualified him to make such judgements and so diffidendy he added that it was only his opinion but he seems like a good man sir he finished let him in morris said he sipped from a tin mug of arrack while sharpe negotiated the muslin screen and then stood to attention beneath the ridge pole hat off boy hakeswill snapped dont you know to take your hat off in the presence of an officer sharpe snatched off his shako well morris asked for a second it seemed that sharpe did not know what to say but then he cleared his diroat and staring at the tent wall a few inches above captain morriss head he at last found his voice permission to marry sir morris grinned marry found yourself a bibbi have you he sipped more arrack then looked at hakeswill how many wives are on the company strengdi now sergeant full complement sir no room for more sir full up sir not a vacancy to be had shall i dismiss private sharpe sir this girls on the complement lieutenant lawford intervened shes sergeant bickerstaffs widow morris stared up at sharpe bickerstaff he said vaguely as though the name was strange to him bickerstaff fellow who died of a fever on the march is that right yes sir hakeswill answered didnt know the man was even married morris said official wife was she very official sir hakeswill answered on the company strength sir colonels signature on the certificate sir proper married before god and the army sir morris sniffed and looked up at sharpe again why on earth do you want to marry sharpe sharpe looked embarrassed just do sir he said lamely cant say i disapprove of marriage morris said steadies a man does marriage but a fellow like you sharpe can do better than a soldiers widow cant you dreadful creatures soldiers widows used goods private fat and greasy like lumps of lard wrapped up in linen get yourself a sweet litde bibbi man something that aint yet run to seed very good advice sir hakeswill said his face twitching words of wisdom sir shall i dismiss him sir mary bickerstaff is a good woman sir lieutenant lawford said the lieutenant whom sharpe had first approached with his request was eager to do his best sharpe could do a lot worse than marry mary bickerstaff sir morris cut a cigar and lit it from the guttering candle that burned on his camp table white is she he asked negligently half bibbi and half christian sir hakeswill said but she had a good man for her husband he sniffed pretending that he was suddenly overcome with emotion and jem bickerstaff aint this month in his grave sir too soon for the trollop to marry again it aint right sir says so in the scriptures morris offered hakeswill a cynical glance dont be absurd sergeant most army widows marry the next day the ranks are hardly high society you know but jem bickerstaff was a friend of mine sir hakeswill said sniffing again and even cuffing at an invisible tear friend of mine sir he repeated more hoarsely and on his dying bed sir he begged me to look after his little wife sir i know she aint through and through white he told me but she deserves to be looked after his very dying words sir he bloody hated you sharpe could not resist the words quiet in front of an officer hakeswill shouted speak when youre spoken to boy and otherwise keep your filthy mouth buttoned like god wanted it morris frowned as though hakeswills loud voice was giving him a headache then he looked up at sharpe ill talk to major shee about it sharpe if the woman is on the strength and wants to marry you then i dont suppose we can stop her ill talk to the major youre dismissed sharpe hesitated wondering whether he should thank the captain for the laconic words but before he could say any thing hakeswill was bawling in his ear about turn smartly now hat on quick march one two one two smartly now mind the bleeding curtain boy this aint a pig sty like what you grew up in but an officers quarters morris waited till sharpe was gone then looked up at lawford nothing more lieutenant lawford guessed that he too was dismissed you will talk to major shee charles he pressed morris i just said so didnt i morris glared up at the lieutenant lawford hesitated then nodded good night sir he said and ducked under the muslin screen morris waited until he was certain that both men were out of earshot now what do we do he asked hakeswill tell the silly bugger that major shee refused permission sir and willie lawford will talk to the major and find that he didnt or else hell go straight to wellesley lawfords uncle is on the staff or had you forgotten that use your wits man morris slapped at a moth that had managed to slip through the screen what do we do he asked again hakeswill sat on a stool opposite the camp table he scratched his head glanced into the night then looked back to morris hes a sharp one sharpie he is slippery but ill do him he paused of course sir if you helped itd be quicker much quicker morris looked dubious the girl will only find herself another protector he said i think youre wasting my time sergeant what me sir no sir not at all sir ill have the girl sir just you watch and nasty naig says you can have all you want of her free and gratis sir like you ought to morris stood pulled on his jacket and picked up his hat and sword you think id share your woman hakeswill the captain shuddered and get your pox pox sir me sir hakeswill stood not me sir clean as a whistle i am sir cured sir mercury his face twitched ask the surgeon sir hell tell you morris hesitated thinking of mary bickerstaff he thought a great deal about mary bickerstaff her beauty ensured that and men on campaign were deprived of beauty and so marys allure only increased with every mile the army marched westwards morris was not alone on the night when marys husband had died the rds officers at least those who had a mind for such games had wagered which of them would first take the widow to their bed and so far none of them had succeeded morris wanted to win not only for the fourteen guineas that would accrue to the successful seducer but because he had become besotted by the woman soon after she had become a widow he had asked mary to do his laundry thinking that thereby he could begin the intimacy he craved but she had refused him with a lacerating scorn morris wanted to punish her for that scorn and hakeswill with his intuition for other mens weaknesses had sensed what morris wanted and promised he would arrange everything naig hakeswill assured his bitter officer had a way of breaking reluctant girls there aint a bibbi born that nasty cant break sir hakeswill had promised morris and hed give a small fortune for a proper white one not that mrs bickerstaffs proper white sir not like a christian but in the dark shed pass well enough the sergeant needed morriss help in ridding mrs bickerstaff of richard sharpe and as an inducement he had offered morris the free run of naigs tent in return morris knew hakeswill would expect a lifetimes patronage as morris climbed the armys ranks so hakeswill would be drawn ineluctably after him and with each step the sergeant would garner more power and influence so when will you free mrs bickerstaff of sharpe morris asked buckling his sword belt tonight sir with your help youll be back here by midnight i dare say i might if you are sir well do him tonight sir morris clapped the cocked hat on his head made sure his purse was in his coattail pocket and ducked under the muslin carry on sergeant he called back sir hakeswill stood to attention for a full ten seconds after the captain was gone and then with a sly grin twitching on his lumpy face followed morris into the night nineteen miles to the south lay a temple it was an ancient place deep in the country one of the many hindu shrines where the country folk came on high days and holidays to do honour to their gods and to pray for a timely monsoon for good crops and for the absence of warlords for the rest of the year the temple lay abandoned its gods and altars and richly carved spires home to scorpions snakes and monkeys the temple was surrounded by a wall through which one gate led though the wall was not high and the gate was never shut villagers left small offerings of leaves flowers and food in niches of the gateposts and sometimes they would go into the temple itself cross the courtyard and climb to the inner shrine where they would place their small gifts beneath the image of a god but at night when the indian sky lay black over a heatexhausted land no one would ever dream of disturbing the gods but this night the night after battle a man entered the temple he was tall and thin with white hair and a harsh suntanned face he was over sixty years old but his back was still straight and he moved with the ease of a much younger man like many europeans who had lived a long time in india he was prone to bouts of debilitating fever but otherwise he was in sterling health and colonel hector mccandless ascribed that good health to his religion and to a regimen that abjured alcohol tobacco and meat his religion was calvinism for hector mccandless had grown up in scotland and the godly lessons that had been whipped into his young earnest soul had never been forgotten he was an honest man a tough man and a wise one his soul was old in experience but even so it was offended by the idols that reflected the small light of the lantern he had lit once he was through the temples ever open gate he had lived in india for over sixteen years now and he was more accustomed to these heathen shrines than to the kirks of his childhood but still whenever he saw these strange gods with their multiplicity of arms their elephant heads their grotesquely coloured faces and their cobrahooded masks he felt a stab of disapproval he never let that disapproval show for that would have imperilled his duty and mccandless was a man who believed that duty was a master second only to god he wore the red coat and the tartan kilt of the kings scotch brigade a highland regiment that had not seen mccandlesss stern features for sixteen years he had served with the brigade for over thirty years but lack of funds had obstructed his promotion and so with his colonels blessing he had accepted a job with the army of the east india company which governed those parts of india that were under british rule in his time he had commanded battalions of sepoys but mccandlesss first love was surveying he had mapped the carnatic coast he had charted the sundarbans of the hoogli and he had once ridden the length and breadth of mysore and while he had been so engaged he had learned a halfdozen indian languages and met a score of princes rajahs and nawabs few men understood india as mccandless did which was why the company had promoted him to colonel and attached him to the british army as its chief of intelligence it was mccandlesss task to advise general harris of the enemys strength and dispositions and in particular to discover just what defences waited for the allied armies when they reached seringapatam it was his search for that particular answer that had brought colonel mccandless to this ancient temple he had surveyed the temple seven years before when lord cornwalliss army had marched against mysore and back then mccandless had admired the extraordinary carvings that covered every inch of the temples walls the scotsmans religion had been offended by so much decoration but he was too honest a man to deny that the old stoneworkers had been marvellous craftsmen for the sculpture here was as fine if not finer than anything produced in medieval europe the wan yellow light of his lantern washed across caparisoned elephants fierce gods and marching armies all made of stone he climbed the steps to the central shrine passed between its vast squat pillars and so went into the sanctuary the roof here beneath the temples high carved tower was fashioned into lotus blossoms the idols stared blankly from their niches with flowers and leaves drying at their feet the colonel placed the lantern on the flagstone floor then sat crosslegged and waited he closed his eyes letting his ears identify the noises of the night beyond the temples walls mccandless had come to this remote temple with an escort of six indian lancers but he had left that escort two miles away in case their presence should have inhibited the man he was hoping to meet so now he just waited with eyes closed and arms folded and after a while he heard the thump of a hoof on dry earth the chink of a snaffle chain and then once again silence and still he waited with eyes closed if you were not in that uniform a voice said a few moments later i would think you were at your prayers the uniform does not disqualify me from prayer any more than does your uniform the colonel answered opening his eyes he stood welcome general the man who faced mccandless was younger than the scot but every inch as tall and lean appah rao was now a general in the forces of the tippoo sultan but once many years before he had been an officer in one of mccandlesss sepoy battalions and it was that old acquaintanceship which had verged upon friendship that had persuaded mccandless it was worth risking his own life to talk to appah rao appah rao had served under mccandlesss orders until his father had died and then trained as a soldier he had returned to his native mysore today he had watched from the ridge as the tippoos infantry had been massacred by a single british volley the experience had made him sour but he forced a grudging courtesy into his voice so youre still alive major appah rao spoke in kanarese the language of the native mysoreans still alive and a full colonel now mccandless answered in the same tongue shall we sit appah rao grunted then sat opposite mccandless behind him beyond the sunken courtyard where they were framed by the temples gateway were two soldiers they were appah raos escort and mccandless knew they must be trusted men for if the tippoo sultan were ever to discover that this meeting had taken place then appah rao and all his family would be killed unless of course the tippoo already knew and was using appah rao to make some mischief of his own the tippoos general was dressed in his masters tigerstriped tunic but over it he wore a sash of the finest silk and slung across his shoulder was a second silk sash from which hung a goldhiked sword his boots were red leather and his hat a coil of watered red silk on which a milkyblue jewel gleamed soft in the lanterns flickering light you were at malavelly today he asked mccandless i was mccandless said malavelly was the nearest village to where the batde had been fought so you know what happened i know the tippoo sacrificed hundreds of your people mccandless said your people general not his appah rao dismissed the distinction the people follow him because they have no choice they follow but do they love him some do appah rao answered but what does it matter why should a ruler want his peoples love their obedience yes but love love is for children mccandless and for gods and for women mccandless smiled tacitly yielding the argument which was not important he did not have to persuade appah rao to treachery the very presence of the mysorean general was proof that he was already halfway to betraying the tippoo but mccandless did not expect the general to yield gracefully there was pride at stake here and appah raos pride was great and needed to be handled as gently as a cocked duelling pistol appah rao had always been thus even when he was a young man in the companys army and mccandless approved of that pride he had always respected appah rao and still did and he believed appah rao returned the respect it was in that belief that the colonel had sent a message to seringapatam the message was carried by one of the companys native agents who wandered as a naked fakir through southern india the message had been concealed in the mans long greasy hair and it had invited appah rao to a reunion with his old commanding officer the reply had specified this temple and this night as the rendezvous appah rao was flirting with treachery but that did not mean he was finding it either easy or pleasant i have a gift mccandless said changing the subject for your rajah he is in need of gifts then this comes with our most humble duty and high respect mccandless took a leather bag from his sporran and placed it beside the lantern the bag chinked as it was laid down and though appah rao glanced at it he did not take it tell your rajah mccandless said that it is our desire to place him back on his throne and who will stand behind his throne appah rao demanded men in red coats you will mccandless said as your family always did and you the general asked what do you want to trade that is the companys business trade why should we become rulers appah rao sneered because you always do you come as merchants but you bring guns and use them to make yourselves into taxmen judges and executioners then you bring your churches he shuddered we come to trade mccandless insisted equably and what would you prefer general to trade with the british or be ruled by muslims and that mccandless knew was the question that had brought appah rao to this temple in the dark night mysore was a hindu country and its ancient rulers the wodeyars were hindus like their people but the tippoos father the fierce hyder ali had come from the north and conquered their state and the tippoo had inherited his fathers stolen throne to give himself a shred of legality the tippoo like his father before him kept the old ruling family alive but the wodeyars were now reduced to poverty and to ceremonial appearances only the new rajah was scarce more than a child but to many of mysores hindus he was still their rightful monarch though that was an opinion best kept secret from the tippoo appah rao had not answered the scotsmans question so mccandless phrased it differently are you the last hindu senior officer in the tippoos army there are others appah rao said evasively and the rest appah rao paused fed to his tigers he eventually admitted and soon general mccandless said softly there will be no more hindu officers in mysore and some very fat tigers and if you defeat us you will still not be safe the french will come appah rao shrugged there are already frenchmen in seringapatam they demand nothing of us yet mccandless said ominously but let me tell you what stirs in the wide world general there is a new french general named bonaparte his army sits on the nile now but there is nothing in egypt that interests bonaparte or the french they have their eyes farther east they have their eyes on india bonaparte wrote to the tippoo earlier this year did the tippoo show you his letter appah rao said nothing and mccandless took the silence to mean that rao knew nothing of the french generals letter and so he took from his sporran a piece of paper do you speak french general no then let me translate for you one of our agents copied the letter before it was sent and it reads le sept plumose van six de la republique frangaise thats the twentyseventh of january this year to the rest of us and it says i have reached the borders of the red sea with an innumerable and invincible army full of the desire to deliver you from the yoke of england here mccandless offered appah rao the letter theres plenty more in the letter like that take it back with you and find someone who will translate it i believe you appah rao said ignoring the proffered letter but why should i fear this french general because bonapartes ally is the tippoo and bonapartes ambition is to take away the companys trade his victory will strengthen the muslims and weaken the hindus but if he sees mysore defeated and if he sees your rajah back on his ancestors throne and if he sees a hindu army led by general appah rao then he will think twice before he takes ship bonaparte needs allies in this land and without mysore he will have none appah rao frowned this bonaparte he is a muslim hes friendly to muslims but he has no religion that we know of if hes friendly to muslims appah rao observed why should he not be friendly to hindus also because it is to the muslims that he looks for allies he will reward them appah rao shifted on the hard floor why should we not let this bonaparte come and defeat you because then he will have made the tippoo all powerful and after that general how long will there be any hindus in his service and how long will the surviving wodeyars live the tippoo keeps the wodeyar family alive for he needs hindu infantry and cavalry but if he no longer has enemies why will he need reluctant friends and you will restore the wodeyars i promise it appah rao looked past mccandless gazing up at the small light reflecting off the serene image of a hindu goddess the temple was still here as were all mysores temples for though the tippoo was a muslim he had not torn down the hindu sanctuaries indeed eke his father the tippoo had restored some of the temples life was not hard under the tippoo but all the same the tippoo was not the ancestral ruler of appah raos country that ruler was a boy kept in poverty in a small house in a back alley of seringapatam and appah raos hidden loyalty was to the wodeyar dynasty not to the muslim interlopers the generals dark eyes shifted to mccandless you british captured the city seven years ago why didnt you replace the tippoo then a mistake mccandless admitted candidly we thought he could be trusted to keep his promises but we were wrong this time if god wills it we shall replace him a man bitten by a snake once does not let the snake live a second time appah rao brooded for a while bats flickered in the courtyard the two men in the gateway watched as mccandless let the silence stretch the colonel knew it would not serve to pressure this general too hard but mccandless also knew he did not need to press appah rao might not be certain that a british victory would be in mysores best interest but what would serve that interest in these hard confusing times appah raos choice lay between the muslim usurpers and foreign domination and mccandless knew only too well of the simmering distrust that lay between hindus and muslims it was that breach that the scotsman was assaulting in the hope that he could widen the rift into full betrayal appah rao finally shook his head then raised an arm and beckoned one of the two men in the gateway came running forward and knelt beside the general he was a young man of startling good looks blackhaired and with a fine long face of strong bones and defiant eyes like appah rao he wore the tiger tunic and had a goldhilted sword slung at his hip this is kunwar singh appah rao introduced the young man he is the son of a cousin of mine he announced the relationship vaguely intimating that it was not close and the commander of my bodyguard mccandless looked into kunwar singhs eyes do your job well my friend your master is valuable kunwar singh smiled and then at a signal from appah rao he took a roll of paper from inside his tunic he unrolled the sheet and weighted its corners with a pistol a knife a handful of bullets and the lantern mccandless leaned forward the scroll was a map and it showed the big island in the river cauvery on which the tippoos capital of seringapatam was built the fortress town occupied the islands western tip while beyond its walls to the east were pleasure gardens suburbs the tippoos summer palace and the mausoleum where the fearsome hyder ali was entombed appah rao drew a knife from his belt he tapped the islands northern bank where it fronted the cauverys main channel that is where general cornwallis crossed but since then the walls have been strengthened the french advised us how to do it there are new guns on the walk hundreds of them he looked up into mccandlesss eyes i mean hundreds mccandless that is not an exaggeration the tippoo is fond of cannon and rockets he has thousands of rocketmen and deep arsenals crammed with weapons all this he swept the knifes tip around the walls that faced the river has been rebuilt refortified and given cannon and rockets we have cannon too mccandless said appah rao ignored the comment instead he tapped the knife against the western ramparts that overlooked the cauverys smaller channel at this time of year mccandless the river here is shallow the crocodiles have gone to the deeper pools and a man can walk across the river with dry knees and when your army reaches seringapatam they will see that these walls he tapped the western fortifications again have not been rebuilt they are made of mud bricks and the rains have crumbled the rampart it looks like a weak place and you will be tempted to attack there do not for that is where the tippoo wants you to attack a beetle flew onto the map and crawled along the line marking the western walls appah rao gently swept the insect aside there is another wall there a new wall hidden behind that rampart mccandless and when your men get through the first wall they will be in a trap here he pointed to a bastion that connected the outer and inner walls that used to be a water gate but its been blocked up and there are hundreds of pounds of gunpowder inside once your men are trapped between the two walls the tippoo plans to blow the mine appah rao shrugged hundreds of pounds of powder mccandless just waiting for you and when that attack has failed you will have no time to make another before the monsoon comes and when the rains do come the river will rise and the roads will turn to mud and you will be forced to retreat and every foot of your way back to madras will be dogged by the tippoos cavalry that is how he plans to beat you so we must attack anywhere but in the west anywhere but from the west appah rao said the new inner wall he demonstrated on the map with the tip of his knife extends all the way round the north these other walls he tapped the southern and eastern ramparts look stronger but dont be deceived the west wall is a trap and if you fall into it it will be your death he moved the weights off the corners of the map and let it roll itself up then he unshielded mccandlesss lantern and held one end of the scroll in the candle flame the paper blazed lighting the intricate carvings of the shrine the three men watched as the paper burned to ash anywhere but from the west appah rao said then after a moments hesitation he lifted the bag of gold coins from beside the lantern all this will go to my rajah he said i shall keep none i never expected you to mccandless said you have my thanks general i dont want your thanks i want my rajah back that is why i came and if you disappoint me then you english will have a new enemy tm a scot but you would still be my enemy appah rao said then turned away but paused and looked back from the inner shrines threshold tell your general that his men should be gentle with the people of the city i will tell general harris then i shall look to see you in seringapatam appah rao said heavily me and thousands of others mccandless said thousands appah raos tone mocked the claim you may have thousands colonel but the tippoo has tigers he turned and walked to the temples outer gateway followed by kunwar singh mccandless burned the copy of bonapartes letter waited another halfhour and then as silently as he had come to the temple he left it he would join his escort sleep a few hours then ride with his precious secret to the wailing army few men of the rd slept that night for the excitement of fighting and beating the tippoos vaunted troops had filled them with a nervous energy some spent their loot on arrack and those fell asleep soon enough but the others stayed around their fires and relived the days brief excitement for most of the troops it had been their first battle and on its slim evidence they built a picture of war and their own valour mary bickerstaff sat with sharpe and listened patiently to the tales she was accustomed to soldiers stories and shrewd enough to know which men exaggerated their prowess and which pretended not to have been nauseated by the horrors of the dead and wounded sharpe after he returned from captain morriss tent with the news that the captain would ask major shees permission for them to marry was silent and mary sensed he was not really listening to the tales not even when he pretended to be amused or amazed what is it she asked him after a long while nothing lass are you worried about captain morris if he says no we just ask major shee sharpe said with a confidence he did not entirely feel morris was a bastard but shee was a drunk and in truth there was litde to choose between them sharpe had an idea that lieutenant colonel arthur wellesley the rds real commanding officer was a man who might be reasonable but wellesley had been temporarily appointed as one of the armys two deputy commanders and had thus shrugged off all regimental business well get our permission he told mary so whats worrying you i told you nothing youre miles away richard he hesitated wish i was mary tightened the grip of her hand on his fingers then lowered her voice to something scarce above a whisper are you thinking of running richard sharpe he leaned away from the fire trying to make a small private space where they could talk without being overheard got to be a better life than this love he said dont do it mary said fiercely but laying a hand on his cheek as she spoke some of the men on the other side of the fire saw the tender gesture and greeted it with a chorus of jeers and whistles mary ignored them theyll catch you richard she insisted catch you and shoot you not if we run far enough we she asked cautiously td want you lass mary took hold of one of his hands and squeezed it listen she hissed work to become a sergeant once youre a sergeant youre made you could even become an officer dont laugh richard mister lambert in calcutta he was a sergeant once and he was a private before that they made him up to ensign sharpe smiled and traced a finger down her cheek youre mad mary i love you but youre mad i couldnt be an officer you have to know how to read i can teach you mary said sharpe glanced at her with some surprise he had never known she could read and the knowledge made him somewhat nervous of her i wouldnt want to be an officer anyway he said scathingly stuckup bastards all of them but you can be a sergeant mary insisted and a good one but dont run love whatever you do dont run is that the lovebirds sergeant hakeswills mocking voice cut through their conversation ah its sweet isnt it good to see a couple in love restores a mans faith in human nature it does sharpe and mary sat up and disentangled their fingers as the sergeant stalked through the ring of men beside the fire i want you sharpie hakeswill said when he reached their side got a message for you i have he touched his hat to mary not you maam he said as she stood to accompany sharpe this is mens business mrs bickerstaff soldiers business no business for bibbis come on sharpie aint got all night look lively now he strode away thumping the ground with the butt of his halberd as he threaded his way between the fires got news for you sharpie he called over his shoulder good news lad good news i can marry sharpe asked eagerly hakeswill threw a sly glance over his shoulder as he led sharpe towards the picketed lines of officers horses now why would a lad like you want to marry why throw all your spunk away on one bibbi eh and that one used goods too another mans leavings thats all mary bickerstaff is you should spread it about boy enjoy yourself when youre still young hakeswill pushed his way between the horses to reach the dark space between the two picketed lines where he turned and faced sharpe good news sharpe you cant marry permission is refused you want to know why boy sharpe felt his hopes crumbling at that moment he hated hakeswill more than ever but his pride forced him not to show that hate nor his disappointment why he asked ill tell you why sharpie hakeswill said and stand still boy when a sergeant condescends to talk to you you stand still tenshun thats better lad bit of respect like what is proper to show to a sergeant his face twitched as he grinned you want to know why boy because i dont want you to marry her sharpie that is why i dont want little mrs bickerstaff married to anyone not to you not to me not even to the king of england himself god bless him he was circling sharpe as he talked and do you know why boy he stopped in front of sharpe and pushed his face up towards the younger man because that mrs bickerstaff is a bibbi sharpie with possibilities possibibbibilities he giggled at his joke got a future she has he grinned again and the grin was suddenly twisted as his face shuddered with its distorting rictus you familiar with naig nasty naig answer me boy ive heard of him sharpe said fat bugger sharpie he is fat and rich rides a helephant he does and hes got a dozen green tents one of the armys followers sharpie and rich as a rich man can be richer than youll ever be sharpie and you know why cos nasty naig provides the officers with their women thats why and im not talking about those rancid slags the other heathens hires out to you nasty common soldiers im talking about the desirable women sharpie desirable he lingered on the word nastys got a whole herd of expensive whores sharpie he does all riding in those closed wagons with the coloured curtains full of officers meat those wagons are fat ones skinny ones dark ones light ones dirty ones clean ones tall ones short ones all sorts of ones and all of em are prettier than you could ever dream of but there aint one of them as pretty as little mrs bickerstaff and there aint one who looks as white as pretty little mary does and if meres one thing an english officer abroad wants once in a while sharpie its a spot of the white meat thats the itch morris has got sharpie got it bad but he aint no different from the others they get bored with the dark meat sharpie and the indian officers naig tells me theyll pay a months wages for a white you following me sharpie you and me marching in step are we sharpe said nothing it had taken all his self discipline not to hit the sergeant and hakeswill knew it and mocked him for it go on sharpie hit me hakeswill taunted him and when sharpe did not move the sergeant laughed you aint got the guts have you iii find a place and time sharpe said angrily place and time listen to him hakeswill chuckled then began pacing around sharpe once again weve made a deal nasty and me like brothers we are me and him just like brothers we understand each other see and nastys right keen on your little mary profit there you see boy and ill get a cut of it mary stays with me sarge sharpe said stubbornly married or not oh sharpie dear me you dont understand do you you didnt hear me boy did you nasty and me weve made a bargain drunk to it we did and not in arrack neither but in proper gentlemens brandy i give him little mrs bickerstaff and he gives me half the money she earns hell cheat me of course hell cheat me but shell make so much that it wont signify she wont have a choice sharpie shell get snatched on the march and given to one of nastys men one of the ugly buggers shell be raped wicked for a week whipped every night and at the end of it sharpie shell do whatever shes told thats the way the business works sharpie says so in the scriptures and how are you going to stop it answer me that boy are you going to pay me more than nasty will hakeswill stopped in front of sharpe where he waited for an answer and when none came he shook his head derisively youre a boy playing in mens games sharpie and youre going to lose unless youre a man are you man enough to fight me here put me down claim i was kicked by a horse in the night you can try sharpie but youre not man enough are you hit you sergeant sharpe said and be put on a flogging charge im not daft hakeswill made an elaborate charade of looking right and left aint no one here but you and me sharpie nice and private sharpe resisted the urge to lash out at his persecutor im not daft he said again stubbornly remaining at attention but you are boy daft as a bucket dont you understand im offering you the soldiers way out forget the bloody officers you daft boy you and me sharpie were soldiers and soldiers settle their arguments by fighting says so in the scriptures dont it so beat me now lad beat me here and now beat me in a square fight and i warrant you can keep mrs bickerstaff all to your little self he paused grinning up into sharpes face thats a promise sharpie fight me now fair and honest and our arguments over but youre not man enough are you youre just a boy im not falling for your tricks sergeant sharpe said there aint no trick boy hakeswill said hoarsely he stepped two paces away from sharpe reversed his halberd and thrust its steel point hard into the turf t can beat you sharpie thats what im reckoning ive been around a bit know how to fight you might be taller than me and you might be stronger but you aint as quick as me and you aint half as dirty im going to pound the bloody guts out of you and when ive finished with you ill take little mary down to nastys tents and earn my money but not if you beat me boy you beat me and on a soldiers honour ill persuade captain morris to let you marry youve got my word on it boy a soldiers honour he waited for an answer you aint a soldier he said scornfully when sharpe still kept quiet you aint got the guts he stepped up to sharpe and slapped him hard across the face nothing but a lily aint you lieutenant lawfords lilyboy maybe thats why you aint got the guts to fight for your mary the last insult provoked sharpe to hit hakeswill he did it hard and fast he slammed a low blow into hakeswills belly that folded the sergeant over then cut his other hand hard up into the sergeants face to split open hakeswills nose and jerk his head back up sharpe brought up his knee missed the sergeants crotch but his left hand had hold of hakeswills clubbed hair now and he was just feeling with his right fingers for the squealing sergeants eyeballs when a voice was suddenly shouting close behind him guard the voice called guard jesus sharpe let go of his enemy turned and saw captain morris standing just beyond the picketed horses ensign hicks was with him hakeswill had sunk onto the ground but now hauled himself upright on the staff of his halberd assaulted me sir he did the sergeant could scarcely speak for the pain in his belly he went mad sir just mad sir dont worry sergeant hicks and i both saw it morris said came to check on the horses aint that right hicks yes sir hicks said he was a small young man very officious who would never contradict a superior if morris claimed the clouds were made of cheese hicks would just stand to attention twitch his nose and swear blind he could smell cheddar plain case of assault sir the ensign said unprovoked assault guard morris shouted here now blood was pouring down hakeswills face but the sergeant managed a grin got you sharpie he said softly got you flogging offence that you bastard sharpe said softly and wondered if he should run he wondered if he would stand any chance of making it safely away if he just sprinted into the dark but ensign hicks had drawn his pistol and the sound of the hammer being cocked stilled sharpes tiny impulse to flee a panting sergeant green arrived with four men of the guard and morris pushed the horses aside to let them through arrest private sharpe sergeant he told green close arrest he struck sergeant hakeswill and hicks and i witnessed the assault ensign hicks will do the paperwork gladly sir hicks agreed the ensign was slurring his words betraying that he had been drinking morris looked at sharpe its a court martial offence sharpe the captain said then he turned back to green who had not moved to obey his orders do it sir green said stepping forward come on sharpie i didnt do nothing sergeant sharpe protested come on lad itll sort itself out green said quietly then he took sharpes elbow and led him away hicks went with them happy to please morris by writing up the charge morris waited until the prisoner and his escort had gone then grinned at hakeswill the boy was faster than you thought sergeant hes a devil that one sir a devil broke my nose he did hakeswill gingerly tried to straighten the cartilage and the bleeding nose made a horrible crunching noise but his womans ours tonight morris could not keep the eagerness from his voice not tonight sir hakeswill said in a tone that suggested the captain had made a foolish suggestion therell be enough trouble in the company with sharpe arrested sir and if we go after his bibbi tonight therell be a rare brawl half the bastards are full of arrack no sir wait till the bastards flogged to death wait for that sir and then theyll all be meek as lambs meek as lambs flogging does that to men quietens them down something proper a good whipping does all be done in a couple of days sir morris flinched as hakeswill tried to straighten his nose again youd better see mister micklewhite hakeswill no sir dont believe in doctors sir except for the pox ill strap it up sir and soon be right as rain besides watching sharpie flogged will be treatment enough i reckon we done him sir you wont have long to wait sir not long at all morris found hakeswills intimate tone unseemly and stepped stiffly back then ill wish you a good night sergeant thank you kindly sir and the same to you sir and sweet dreams too sir hakeswill laughed just as sweet as sweet can ever be sir for sharpie was done chapter colonel mccandless woke as the dawn touched the worlds rim with a streak of fire the crimson light glowed bright on the lower edge of a long cloud that lay on the eastern horizon like the smoke rill left by a musket volley it was the only cloud in the sky he rolled his plaid and tied it onto his saddles cantle then rinsed his mouth with water his horse picketed close by had been saddled all night in case some enemy discovered mccandless and his escort that escort six picked men of the th native cavalry had needed no orders to be about the day they grinned a greeting at mccandless stowed their meagre bedding then made a breakfast out of warm canteen water and a dry cake of ground lentils and rice mccandless shared the cavalrymens meal he liked a cup of tea in the mornings but he dared not light a fire for the smoke might attract the pestilential patrols of the tippoos light cavalry tt will be a hot day sahib the havildar remarked to mccandless theyre all hot mccandless answered havent had a cold day since i came here he thought for a second then worked out that it must be thursday the twentyeighth of march it would be cold in scotland today and for an indulgent moment he thought of lochaber and imagined the snow lying deep in glen scaddle and the ice edging the lochs foreshore and though he could see the image clearly enough he could not really imagine what the cold would feel like he had been away from home too long and now he wondered if he could ever live in scotland again he certainly would not live in england not in hampshire where his sister lived with her petulant english husband harriet kept pressing him to retire to hampshire saying that they had no relatives left in scotland and that her husband had a wee cottage that would suit mccandlesss declining years to perfection but the colonel had no taste for a soft plump english landscape nor indeed for his soft plump sisters company harriets son mccandlesss nephew william lawford was a decent enough young fellow even if he had forgotten his scottish ancestry but young william was now in the army here in mysore indeed which meant that the only relative mccandless liked was close at hand and that circumstance merely strengthened mccandlesss distaste for retiring to hampshire but to scotland he often dreamed of going back though whenever the opportunity arose for him to take the companys pension and sail to his native land he always found some unfinished business that kept him in india next year he promised himself the year of our lord would be a good year to go home though in truth he had promised himself the same thing every year for the last decade the seven men unpicketed the horses and hauled themselves into their worn saddles the indian escort was armed with lances sabres and pistols while mccandless carried a claymore a horse pistol and a carbine that was holstered on his saddle he glanced once towards the rising sun to check his direction then led his men northwards he said nothing but he needed to give these men no orders they knew well enough to keep a keen lookout in this dangerous land for this was the kingdom of mysore high on the southern indian plateau and as far as the horsemen could see the land was under the rule of the tippoo sultan indeed this was the tippoos heartland a fertile plain rich with villages fields and water cisterns only now as the british army advanced and the tippoos retreated the country was being blighted mccandless could see six pillars of smoke showing where the tippoos cavalry had burned granaries to make sure that the hated british could not find food the cisterns would all have been poisoned the livestock driven westwards and every storehouse emptied thus forcing the armies of britain and hyderabad to carry all their own supplies on the cumbersome bullock carts mccandless guessed that yesterdays brief and unequal battle had been an attempt by the tippoo to draw the escorting troops away from the precious baggage onto his infantry after which he would have released his fearsome horsemen onto the wagons of grain and rice and salt but the british had not taken the bait which meant that general harriss ponderous advance would continue say another week until they arrived at seringapatam then they would face two months of short rations and searing weather before the monsoon broke but mccandless reckoned that two months was plenty enough time to do the job especially as the british would soon know how to avoid the tippoos trap at the western walls he threaded his horse through a grove of cork trees glad of the shade cast by the deepgreen leaves he paused at the groves edge to watch the land ahead which dropped gently into a valley where a score of people were working in rice paddies the valley mccandless supposed lay far enough from the line of the british advance to have been spared the destruction of its stores and water supply a small village lay to the west of the rice paddies and mccandless could see another dozen people working in the small gardens around the houses and he knew that he and his men would be spotted as soon as they left the cover of the cork grove but he doubted that any of the villagers would investigate seven strange horsemen the folk of mysore like villagers throughout all the indian states avoided mysterious soldiers in the hope that the soldiers would avoid them at the far side of the rice paddies were plantations of mango and date palms and beyond them a bare hill crest mccandless watched that empty crest for a few minutes and then satisfied that no enemy was nearby he spurred his mare forward the people working the rice immediately fled towards their homes and mccandless swerved eastwards to show them he meant no harm then kicked the mare into a trot he rode beside a grove of carefully tended mulberry trees part of the tippoos scheme to make silk weaving into a major industry of mysore then he spurred into a canter as he approached the bed of the valley his escorts curb and scabbard chains jingled behind him as the horses pounded down the slope splashed through the shrunken stream that trickled from the paddies then began the gentle climb to the date palm grove it was then that mccandless saw the flash of light in the mango trees he instinctively dragged his horse around to face the rising sun and pricked back his spurs he looked behind as he rode hoping that the flash of light was nothing but some errant reflection but men he saw horsemen spurring from the trees they carried lances and all of them were dressed in the tigerstriped tunic there were a dozen men at least but the scotsman had no time to count them properly for he was plunging his spurs back to race his mare diagonally up the slope towards the crest one of the pursuing horsemen fired a shot that echoed through the valley the bullet went wide mccandless doubted it had been supposed to hit anything but was rather intended as a signal to alert other horsemen who must be in the area for a second or two the scotsman debated turning and charging directly at his pursuers but he rejected the idea the odds were marginally too great and his news far too important to be gambled on a skirmish flight was his only option he pulled the carbine from its saddle holster cocked it then clapped his heels hard onto the mares flank once over the crest he reckoned there was a good chance he could outrun his pursuers goats scattered from his path as he spurred the mare over the ridges skyline one glance behind satisfied mccandless that he had gained a long enough lead to let him turn north without being headed off and so he twitched the rein and let the mare run a long stretch of open treedotted country lay ahead and beyond were thick stands of timber in which he and his escort could lose themselves run girl he called to the mare then looked behind to make certain his escort was closed up and safe sweat dripped down his face his scabbarded claymore thumped up and down on his hip but the strong mare was running like the wind now her speed blowing the kilt back up around his hips this was not the first time mccandless had raced away from enemies he had once run for a whole day dawn to twilight to escape a mahratta band and the mare had never once lost her footing in all india and that meant all the world mccandless had no friend better than this mare run girl he called to her again then looked behind once more and it was then that the havildar shouted a warning mccandless turned to see more horsemen coming from the trees to the north there must have been fifty or sixty horsemen racing towards the scotsman and even as he swerved the mare eastwards he realized that his original dozen pursuers must have been the scouts for this larger party of cavalry and that by running north he had been galloping towards the enemy rather than away from them now he rode towards the rising sun again but there was no cover to the east and these new pursuers were already dangerously close he angled back to the south hoping he might find some shelter in the valley beyond the crest but then a wild volley of shots sounded from his pursuers one bullet struck the mare it was a fortunate shot fired at the gallop and ninetynine times out of a hundred such a shot would have flown yards wide but this ball struck the mares haunch and mccandless felt her falter he slapped her rump with the stock of his carbine and she tried to respond but the bullet had driven close to the mares spine and the pain was growing and she stumbled neighed yet still she tried to run again then one of her back legs simply stopped working and the horse slewed round in a cloud of dust mccandless kicked his feet out of the stirrups as his escort galloped past the havildar was already hauling on his reins wheeling his horse to rescue mccandless but the scotsman knew it was too late he sprawled on the ground hurled free of the falling mare and shouted at the havildar go man he called go but the escort had sworn to protect the colonel and instead of fleeing the havildar led his men towards the rapidly approaching enemy you fools mccandless shouted after them brave fools but fools he was bruised but otherwise unhurt though his mare was dying she was whinnying and somehow she had managed to raise the front part of her body on her forelegs and seemed puzzled that her back legs would not work she whinnied again and mccandless knew she would never again run like the wind and so he did the friends duty he went to her head pulled it down by the reins kissed her nose and then put a bullet into her skull just above her eyes she reared back whiteeyed and with blood spraying then she slumped down her forelegs kicked a few times and after that she was still the flies came to settle on her wounds the havildars small group rode full tilt into the enemys pursuit that enemy had been scattered by their gallop and the havildars men were closed up and so the first few seconds were an easy victory two lances found mysore bellies two sabres drew more blood but then the main body of the enemy crashed into the fight the havildar himself had ridden clean through the leading ranks leaving his lance behind and he now looked back to see his men fighting desperately among a milling group of enemy horsemen he drew his sabre and turned back to help when he heard mccandless shouting go man go go mccandless yelled pointing north the havildar could not take back the vital news mccandless had gained from appah rao but it was still important to let the army know that the colonel had been captured mccandless was not a vain man but he knew his own value and he had left some careful instructions that might retrieve some of the damage of his capture those instructions offered a chance for the army to rescue mccandless and that dangerous expedient was now the scotsmans only hope of passing on appah raos message go mccandless roared as loudly as he could the havildar was caught between his duty to his men and his duty to obey mccandlesss orders he hesitated and two of the pursuers swerved aside to pounce on him that made up his mind he clapped his spurs back charged the pursuers touched the rein at the last moment and swung his sabre as he went past the two men the blade sliced across the nape of the nearer mans neck and then the havildar curved away northwards galloping free while the rest of the enemy gathered about the survivors for the kill mccandless threw down his pistol and carbine drew his heavy claymore and walked towards the melee he never reached it for an enemy officer detached himself from the clash of sabres and turned his horse to meet the scotsman the mysorean officer sheathed his sabre then mutely held out his right hand for mccandlesss blade behind him the sabres and lances worked briefly then the small fight was over and mccandless knew that his escort all but the havildar was dead he looked at the horseman above him this sword he said bitterly belonged to my father and to his father he spoke in english this sword mccandless said was carried for charles stuart at culloden the officer said nothing just held his hand out his eyes steady on mccandless the scotsman slowly reversed his blade then held the hilt upwards the mysorean officer took it and seemed surprised by the claymores weight what were you doing here the officer asked in kanarese do you speak english mccandless asked in that tongue determined to hide his knowledge of indias languages the officer shrugged he looked at the old claymore then slid it into his sash his men their horses white with sweat gathered excitedly to stare at the captured heathen they saw an old man and some wondered if they had captured the enemys general but the captive seemed to speak no language any of them knew and so his identity would have to wait he was given one of his dead escorts horses and then as the sun climbed towards its daily furnace heat mccandless was taken west towards the tippoos stronghold while behind him the vultures circled and at last sure that nothing lived where the dust and flies had settled on the newly made corpses flew down for dieir feast it took two days to convene the court martial the army could not spare the time in its march for the business to be done immediately and so captain morris had to wait until the great ponderous horde was given a halfdays rest to allow the straggling herds to catch up with the main armies only then was there time to assemble the officers and have private sharpe brought into major shees tent which had one of its sides brailed up to make more space captain morris laid the charge and sergeant hakeswill and ensign hicks gave evidence major john shee was irritable the major was irritable at the best of times but the need to stay at least apparently sober had only shortened his already short irish temper he did not in truth enjoy commanding the rd major shee suspected when he was sober enough to suspect anything that he did the job badly and that suspicion had given rise to a haunting fear of mutiny and mutiny to major shees befuddled mind was signalled by any sign of disrespect for established authority private sharpe was plainly a man who brimmed over with such disrespect and the offence with which he was charged was plain and the remedy just as obvious but the court proceedings were delayed because lieutenant lawford who should have spoken for sharpe was not present then where the devil is he shee demanded captain fillmore commander of the fourth company spoke for lawford he was summoned to general harriss tent sir shee frowned at fillmore he knew he was supposed to be here indeed sir but the general insisted and were just supposed to twiddle our thumbs while he takes tea with the general shee demanded captain fillmore glanced through the tents open side as if he hoped to see lawford hurrying towards the court martial but there were only sentries to be seen lieutenant lawford did ask me to assure the court sir that private sharpe is a most reliable man fillmore said fearing that he was not doing a very good job of defending the unfortunate prisoner the lieutenant would have spoken most forcibly for the prisoners character sir and begged the court to grant him the benefit of any doubt doubt shee snapped what doubt is diere he struck a sergeant he was seen doing it by two officers and you think theres doubt its an openandshut case thats what it is open and shut fillmore shrugged ensign fitzgerald would also like to say something shee glared at fitzgerald not much to say ensign i trust whatever it might take sir to prevent a miscarriage of justice fitzgerald young and confident stood and smiled at his commanding officer and fellow irishman i doubt weve a better soldier in the regiment sir and i suspect private sharpe was given provocation captain morris says not shee insisted and so does ensign hicks i cannot contradict the captain sir fitzgerald said blandly but i was drinking with timothy hicks earlier that evening sir and if his eyes werent crossed by midnight then he must possess a belly like a flanders cauldron shee looked dangerously belligerent are you accusing a fellow officer of being under the influence of liquor fitzgerald reckoned that most of the rds mess was ever under the influence of arrack rum or brandy but he also knew better than to say as much im just agreeing with captain fillmore sir that we should give private sharpe the benefit of the doubt doubt shee spat there is no doubt open and shut he gestured at sharpe who stood hatless in front of his escort flies crawled on sharpes face but he was not allowed to brush them away shee seemed to shudder at the thought of sharpes villainy he struck a sergeant in full view of two officers and you think theres doubt about what happened i do sir fitzgerald declared forcibly indeed i do sergeant hakeswills face twitched he watched fitzgerald with loathing major shee stared at fitzgerald for a few seconds then shook his head as though questioning the ensigns sanity captain fillmore tried one last time fillmore doubted the evidence of morris and hicks and he had never trusted hakeswill but he knew shee could never be persuaded to take the word of a private against that of two officers and a sergeant might i beg the court fillmore said respectfully to suspend judgment until lieutenant lawford can speak for the prisoner what can lawford say in the name of god shee demanded there was a flask of arrack waiting in his baggage and he wanted to get these proceedings over and done he had a brief muttered conversation with his two fellow judges both of them field officers from other regiments then glared at the prisoner youre a damned villain sharpe and the army has no need of villains if you cant respect audiority then dont expect authority to respect you two thousand lashes he ignored the shudder of astonishment and horror that some of the onlookers gave and looked instead at the sergeant major how soon can it be done this afternoons as good a time as any sir bywaters answered stolidly he had expected a flogging verdict though not as severe as this and he had already made the necessary arrangements shee nodded parade the battalion in two hours these proceedings are over he gave sharpe one foul glance then pushed his chair back he would need some arrack shee thought if he was to sit his horse in the sun through two thousand lashes maybe he should have only given one thousand for a thousand lashes were as liable to kill as two but it was too late now the verdict was given and shees only hope of respite from the dreadful heat was his hope that the prisoner would die long before the awful punishment was finished sharpe was kept under guard his sentinels were not men from his own battalion but six men from the kings iath who did not know him and who could therefore be trusted not to connive in his escape they kept him in a makeshift pen behind shees tent and no one spoke to sharpe there until sergeant green arrived im sorry about this sharpie green said stepping over the ammunition boxes that formed the crude walls of the pen sharpe was sitting with his back against the boxes he shrugged ive been whipped before sergeant not in the army lad not in the army here green held out a canteen its rum sharpe uncorked the canteen and drank a good slug of the liquor i didnt do nothing anyway he said sullenly maybe maybe not green said but the more you drink the less youll feel finish it lad tomkins says you dont feel a damn thing after the first thirty sharpe said i hope hes right lad i hope hes right but you drink that rum anyway green took off his shako and wiped the sweat from his bald head with a scrap of rag sharpe tipped the canteen again and where was mister lawford he asked bitterly you heard son he was called off to see the general green hesitated but what could he have said anyway he added sharpe leaned his head against the boxbuilt wall he could have said that morris is a lying bastard and that hicks will say anything to please him no he couldnt say that lad and you know it green filled a clay pipe with tobacco and lit it with his tinderbox he sat on the ground opposite sharpe and saw the fear in the younger mans eyes sharpe was doing his best to hide it but it was plainly there and so it should be for only a fool did not fear two thousand lashes and only a lucky man came away alive no man had ever actually walked away from such a punishment but a handful had recovered after a month in the sick tent your marys all right green told sharpe sharpe gave a sullen grimace you know what hakeswill told me that he was going to sell her as a whore green frowned he wont lad he wont and how will you stop him sharpe asked bitterly shes being looked after now green reassured him the lads are making sure of that and the women are all protecting her but for how long sharpe asked he drank more of the rum which seemed to be having no effect that he could sense he momentarily closed his eyes he knew he had been given an effective death sentence but there was always hope some men had survived their ribs might have been bared to the sun and their skin and flesh be hanging from their backs in bloody ribbons yet they had lived but how was he to look after mary when he was bandaged in a bed if he was even lucky enough to reach a sick bed instead of a grave he felt tears pricking at his eyes not for the punishment he faced but for mary how long can they protect her he asked gruffly cursing himself for being so near to weeping i tell you shell be all right green insisted you dont know hakeswill sharpe said oh but i do lad i do green said feelingly then paused for a second or two he looked embarrassed then glanced up at sharpe the bastard cant touch her if shes married married proper i mean with the colonels blessing thats what i thought green drew on the pipe if the worst does happen sharpie he said then stopped in embarrassment again aye sharpe prompted him not that it will of course green said hurriedly billy nixon survived a couple of thousand tickles but you probably dont remember him do you little fellow with a wall eye he survived all right he was never quite the same afterwards of course but youre a tough lad sharpie tougher than billy but if the worst does happen sharpe reminded the sergeant well green said colouring but then at last he summoned the courage to say what he had come to say i mean if it dont offend you lad and only if the worst does happen which of course it wont and i pray it wont but if it does then i thought i might ask for mrs bickerstaffs hand myself if you follow my meaning sharpe almost laughed but then the thought of two thousand lashes choked off even the beginnings of a smile two thousand he had seen men with backs looking like offal after just a hundred lashes and how the hell was he to survive with another nineteen hundred strokes on top of that such survival really depended on the battalion surgeon if mister micklewhite thought sharpe was dying after five or six hundred lashes he might stop the punishment to give his back time to heal before the rest of the lashes were given but micklewhite was not known for stopping whippings the rumour in the battalion was that so long as the man did not scream like a baby and thus disturb the more squeamish of the officers the surgeon would keep the blows coming even if they were falling onto a dead mans spine that was the rumour and sharpe could only hope it was not true did you hear me sharpie sergeant green interrupted sharpes gloomy thoughts i heard you sergeant sharpe said so would you mind if i asked her have you asked her already sharpe said accusingly no green said hastily wouldnt be right not while youre still well you know alive sharpe said bitterly its only if the worst happens green tried to sound optimistic which it wont you wont need my permission when im dead sergeant no but if i can tell mary you wanted her to accept me then itd help dont you see that ill be a good man to her sharpie i was married before i was only she died on me but she never complained about me no more than any woman ever complains anyhow hakeswill might stop you marrying her green nodded aye he might but i cant see how not if we tie the knot quick ill ask major shee and hes always fair with me ask him tonight see but only if the worst happens but you need a chaplain sharpe warned the sergeant the rds own chaplain had committed suicide on the voyage from calcutta to madras and no marriage in the army was considered official unless it had the regimental commanders permission and the blessing of a chaplain the lads in the old dozen tell me theyve got a godwalloper green said gesturing at the soldiers guarding sharpe and he can do the splicing tomorrow ill probably have to slip the bugger a shilling but marys worth a bob sharpe shrugged ask her sergeant he said ask her what else could he say and if mary was properly married to sergeant green then she would be protected by the armys regulations but see what happens to me first sharpe added of course i will sharpie hope for the best eh never say die sharpe drained the canteen theres a couple of things in my pack sergeant a good pistol i took off an indian officer the other day and a few coins youll give them to mary of course i will green said carefully hiding the fact that hakeswill had already plundered sharpes pack shell be all right sharpie promise you lad and some dark night sergeant give bloody hakeswill a kicking for me green nodded be a pleasure sharpie be a pleasure he knocked the ashes of his pipe against the ammunition boxes then stood ill bring you some more rum lad the more the better the preparations for sharpes flogging had all been made not that they were many but it took a few moments to make sure everything was to the sergeant majors satisfaction a tripod had been constructed out of three sergeants halberds their spear points uppermost and lashed together so that the whole thing stood two feet higher than a tall man the three halberd butts were sunk into the dry soil then a fourth halberd was firmly lashed crosswise on one face of the tripod at the height of a mans armpits sergeant hakeswill personally selected two of the rds drummer boys the drummer boys always administered the floggings a small element of mercy in a bestial punishment but hakeswill made certain that the two biggest and strongest boys were given the task and then he collected the two whips from the sergeant major and made the boys practise on a tree trunk put your body into it lads he told them and keep the arm moving fast after the whips landed like this he took one of the whips and slashed it across the bark then showed them how to keep the lash sliding across the target by following the stroke through i did it often enough when i was a drummer he told them and i always did a good job best flogger in the battalion i was second to none once he was sure their technique was sufficient for the task he warned them not to tire too quickly and then with a pocket knife he nicked the edges of the leather lashes so that their abrasions would tear at the exposed flesh as they were dragged across sharpes back do it well lads he promised them and theres one of these for each of you he showed them one of the tippoos gold coins which had been part of the battles loot i dont want this bastard walking again he told them nor do you neither for if sharpie ever finds his feet hell give you two a rare kicking so make sure you finish the bastard off proper whip him bloody then put him underground like it says in the scriptures hakeswill coiled the two whips and hung them on the halberd that was mounted crosswise on the tripod then went to find the surgeon mister micklewhite was in his tent where he was trying to tie his white silk stock in preparation for the punishment parade he grunted when he saw hakeswill you dont need more mercury do you he snarled no sir cured sir thanks to your worships skill sir clean as a whistle i am sir micklewhite swore as the knot in the damned stock loosened he did not like hakeswill but like everyone else in the regiment he feared him there was a wildness in the back of hakeswills childlike eyes that spoke of terrible mischief and though the sergeant was always punctilious in his dealings with officers micklewhite still felt obscurely threatened so what do you want sergeant major shee asked me to say a word sir couldnt speak to me himself you know the major sir no doubt hes thirsty a hot day hakeswills face quivered in a series of tremors its about the prisoner sir what about him troublemaker sir known for it a thief a liar and a cheat so hes a redcoat so so major shee aint keen to see him back among the living sir if you follow my meaning is this what i owe you for the mercury sir hakeswill held up a gold coin a haideri which was worth around two shillings and sixpence the coin was certainly not payment for the cure of his pox for that cost had already been deducted from the sergeants pay so micklewhite knew it was a bribe not a great bribe but half a crown could still go a long way micklewhite glanced at it then nodded put it on the table sergeant thank you sir micklewhite tugged the silk stock tight then waved hakeswill off he pulled on his coat and pocketed the gold coin the bribe had not been necessary for micklewhites opposition to the coddling of flogging victims was well enough known in the battalion micklewhite hated caring for men who had been flogged for in his experience they almost always died and if he did stop a punishment then the recovering victim only cluttered up his sick cots and if by some miracle the man was restored to health it was only so he could be strapped to the triangle to be given the rest of his punishment and that second dose almost always proved fatal and so all things considered it was more prudent to let a man die at the first flogging it saved money on medicine and in micklewhites view it was kinder too micklewhite buttoned his coat and wondered just why sergeant hakeswill wanted this particular man dead not that micklewhite really cared he just wanted the bloody business over and done the rd paraded under the afternoons burning sun four companies faced the tripod while three were arrayed at either side so that the battalions ten companies formed a hollow oblong with the tripod standing in the one empty long side the officers sat on their horses in front of their companies while major shee his aides and the adjutant stood their horses just behind the tripod mister micklewhite his head protected from the sun by a wide straw hat stood to one side of the triangle major shee fortified by arrack and satisfied that everything was in proper order nodded to bywaters you will begin punishment sergeant major sir bywaters acknowledged then turned and bellowed for the prisoner to be fetched the two drummer boys stood nervously with their whips in hand they alone of the parading soldiers were in shirtsleeves while everyone else was in full wool uniform women and children peered between the company intervals mary bickerstaff was not there hakeswill had looked for her wanting to enjoy her horror but mary had stayed away the women who had come for the spectacle like their men were silent and sullen sharpe was a popular man and hakeswill knew that everyone here was hating him for engineering this flogging but obadiah hakeswill had never been concerned by such enmity power did not lie in being liked but in being feared sharpe was brought to the triangle he was bareheaded and already stripped to the waist the skin of his chest and back were as white as his powdered hair and contrasted oddly with his darkly tanned face he walked steadily for though he had the best part of a pint of rum in his belly the liquor had not seemed to have the slightest effect he did not look at either hakeswill or morris as he walked to the tripod arms up lad the sergeant major said quietly stand against the triangle feet apart theres a good lad sharpe obediently stepped up to the triangular face of the tripod two corporals knelt at his feet and lashed his ankles to the halberds then stood and pushed his arms over the crosswise halberd they pulled his hands down and tied them to the uprights thus forcing his naked back up and outwards that way he could not sag between the triangle and so hope to exhaust some of the blows on the halberd staffs the corporals finished their knots then stepped back the sergeant major went to the back of the triangle and brought from his pouch a folded piece of leather that was deeply marked by tooth prints open your mouth lad he said softly he smelt the rum on the prisoners breadi and hoped it would help him survive then he pushed the leather between sharpes teeth the gag served a double purpose it would stifle any cries the victim might make and would stop him biting off his tongue be brave boy bywaters said quietly dont let the regiment down sharpe nodded bywaters stepped smartly back and came to attention prisoner ready for punishment sir he called to major shee the major looked to the surgeon is the prisoner fit for punishment mister micklewhite micklewhite did not even give sharpe a glance hale and fit sir then carry on sergeant major right boys the sergeant major said do your duty lay it on hard now and keep the strokes high above his trousers drummer begin a third drummer boy was standing behind the floggers he lifted his sticks paused then brought the first stick down the boy to the right brought his whip hard down on sharpes back one bywaters shouted the whip had left a red mark across sharpes shoulder blades sharpe had flinched but the rope fetters restricted his movement and only those close to the triangle saw the tremor run through his muscles he stared up at major shee who took good care to avoid the baleful gaze two bywaters called and the drummer brought down his stick as the second boy planted a red mark crosswise on the first hakeswills face twitched uncontrollably but he was smiling under the rictus for the drumbeat of death had begun colonel mccandless stood alone in the centre of the courtyard of the tippoos inner palace inside seringapatam the scotsman was still in his full uniform redcoated tartankilted and with his featherplumed cocked hat on his head six tigers were chained to the courtyards walls and those tigers sometimes strained to reach him but they were always checked by the heavy chains that quivered taudy whenever one of the muscled beasts sprang towards the scotsman mccandless did not move and the tigers after one or two fruitless lunges contented themselves with snarling at him the tigers keepers big men armed with long staves watched from the courtyard entrance it was those men who might receive the orders to unleash the tigers and mccandless was determined to show them a calm face the courtyard was covered with sand its lower walls were of dressed stone but above the stone the palaces second storey was a riot of stuccoed teak that had been painted red white green and yellow that decorated second storey was composed of moorish arches and mccandless knew just enough arabic to guess that the writing incised above each arch was a surah from the koran there were two entrances to the courtyard the one behind mccandless through which he had entered and where the tigers keepers now stood was a plain double gateway that led to a tangle of stables and storehouses behind the palace while in front of him and evidendy leading into the palaces staterooms was a brief marble staircase rising to a wide door of black wood that had been decorated with patterns of inlaid ivory above that lavish door was a balcony that jutted out from three of the stuccoed arches a screen of intricately carved wood hid the balcony but mccandless could see that there were men behind the screen he suspected the tippoo was there and the scotsman trusted so was the frenchman who had first questioned him colonel gudin had struck him as an honest fellow and right now mccandless hoped gudin was pleading to let him live though mccandless had taken good care not to offer the frenchman his real name he feared that the tippoo would recognize it and realize just what a prize his cavalry had taken and so the scotsman had given his name as ross instead mccandless was right colonel gudin and the tippoo were both staring down through the screen this colonel ross the tippoo asked he says he was looking for forage yes sir gudin replied through the interpreter you believe him it was plain from his tone that the tippoo was sceptical gudin shrugged their horses are thin the tippoo grunted he had done his best to deny the advancing enemy any food but the british had taken to making sudden marches north or south of their approach to enter territory where his horsemen had not yet destroyed the villagers supplies not only that but they had brought a vast amount of food with them yet even so the tippoos spies reported that the enemy was going hungry their horses and oxen were especially ill fed so it was not unlikely that this british officer had been searching for forage but why would a full colonel be sent on such an errand the tippoo could find ho answer to that and the question fed his suspicions could he have been spying scouting maybe gudin said but not spying spies do not ride in uniform your majesty the tippoo grunted when the answer was translated into persian he was a naturally suspicious man as any ruler should be but he consoled himself with the observation that whatever this britisher had been doing he must have failed the tippoo turned to his entourage and saw the tall darkfaced appah rao you think this colonel ross was looking for food general appah rao knew exactly who colonel ross truly was and what mccandless had been looking for and worse rao now knew that his own treachery was in dire danger of being discovered which meant that this was no time to look weak in front of the tippoo but nor was appah rao ready to betray mccandless that was partly because of an old friendship and partly because appah rao half suspected he might have a better future if he was allied to the british we know theyre short of food he said and that man looks thin enough so you dont consider him a spy spy or not appah rao said coldly he is your enemy the tippoo shrugged at the evasive answer his good sense suggested that the prisoner was not a spy for why would he wear his uniform but even if he was that did not worry the tippoo overmuch he expected seringapatam was full of spies just as he had two score of his own men marching with the british but most spies in the tippoos experience were useless they passed on rumours they inflated guesses and they muddled far more than they ever made plain kill him one of the tippoos muslim generals suggested i shall think about it the tippoo said and turned back through one of the balconys inner archways into a gorgeous room of marble pillars and painted walls the room was dominated by his throne which was a canopied platform eight feet wide five foot deep and held four feet above the tiled floor by a model of a snarling tiger that supported the platforms centre and was flanked on each side by four carved tiger legs two silver gilt ladders gave access to the thrones platform which was made of ebony wood on which a sheet of gold thick as a prayer mat had been fixed with silver nails the edge of the platform was carved with quotations from the koran the arabic letters picked out in gold while above each of the thrones eight legs was a finial in the form of a tigers head the tiger heads were each the size of a pineapple cast from solid gold and studded with rubies emeralds and diamonds the central tiger whose long lean body supported the middle of the throne was made of wood covered with gold while its head was entirely of gold the tigers mouth was open revealing teeth cut from rock crystal between which a gold tongue was hinged so that it could be moved up and down the canopy above the golden platform was supported by a curved pole which like the canopy itself had been covered with sheet gold the fringes of the canopy were made of strung pearls and at its topmost point was a golden model of the fabulous hummah the royal bird that rose from fire the hummah like the tiger finials was studded with jewels its back was one solid glorious emerald and its peacocklike tail a dazzle of precious stones arrayed so thickly that the underlying gold was scarcely visible the tippoo did not spare the gorgeous throne a glance he had ordered the throne made but had then sworn an oath that he would never climb its silver steps nor sit on the cushions of its golden platform until he had at last driven the british from southern india only then would he take his royal place beneath the pearlstrung canopy and until that bright day the tiger throne would stay empty the tippoo had made his oath and the oath meant that he would either sit on the tiger throne or else he would die and the tippoos dreams had given him no presentiment of death instead he expected to expand mysores frontiers and to drive the infidel british into the sea where they belonged for they had no business here they had their own land and if that far country was not good enough for them then let them all drown so the british must go and if their destruction meant an alliance with the french then that was a small price to pay for the tippoos ambitions he envisaged his empire spreading throughout southern india then northwards into the mahratta territories which were all ruled by weak kings or child kings or by tired kings and in their place the tippoo would offer what his dynasty had already given to mysore a firm and tolerant government the tippoo was a muslim and a devout one but he knew the surest way to lose his throne was to upset his hindu subjects and so he took good care to show their temples reverence he did not entirely trust the hindu aristocracy and he had done what he could to weaken that elite over the years but he wished only prosperity on his other hindu subjects for if they were prosperous then they would not care what god was worshipped in the new mosque that the tippoo had built in the city in time he prayed every person in mysore would kneel to allah but until that happy day he would take care not to stir the hindus into rebellion he needed them he needed them to fight for him against the infidel british he needed them to cut down the redcoated enemy before the walls of seringapatam for it was here on his island capital that the tippoo expected to defeat the british and their allies from hyderabad here in front of his tigermuzzled guns the redcoats would be beaten down like rice under a flail he hoped they could be lured into the slaughteryard he was preparing on the western bastions but even if they did not take the bait and came at the southern or eastern walls he was still ready for them he had thousands of cannon and thousands of rockets and thousands of men ready to fight he would turn their infidel army into blood and he would destroy the army of hyderabad and then he would hunt down the nizam of hyderabad a fellow muslim and torture him to a slow and deserved death which the tippoo would watch from his canopied golden throne he walked past the throne to stare at his favourite tiger this one was a lifesize model made by a french craftsman that showed a fullgrown beast crouching above the carved figure of a british redcoat there was a handle in the tigers flank and when it was turned the tigers paw mauled at the redcoats face and reeds hidden within the tigers body made a growling sound and a pathetic noise that imitated the cries of a man dying a flap opened in the tigers flank to reveal a keyboard on which an organ concealed in the tigers belly could be played but the tippoo rarely bothered with the instrument preferring to operate the separate bellows that made the tiger growl and the victim cry out he turned the handle now delighting in the thin reedy sound of the dying man in a few days time he thought he would stun the very heavens with the genuine cries of dying redcoats the tippoo finally let the tiger organ fall silent i suspect the man is a spy he said suddenly then kill him appah rao said a failed spy the tippoo said you say he is a scot he asked gudin indeed your majesty not english then no sire the tippoo shrugged at the distinction whatever his tribe he is an old man but is that reason to show him mercy the question was directed at colonel gudin who once it was translated stiffened he was captured in uniform your majesty so he does not deserve death gudin would have liked to add that it would be uncivilized even to contemplate killing such a prisoner but he knew the tippoo hated being patronized and so he kept silent he is here is he not the tippoo demanded does that not deserve death this is not his land these are not his people and the bread and water he consumes are not his kill him your majesty gudin warned and the british will show no mercy on any prisoners they take i am full of mercy the tippoo said and mostly that was true there was a time for being ruthless and a time for showing mercy and maybe this scotsman would be a useful pawn if there was a need to hold a hostage besides the tippoos dream the night before had promised well and this mornings auguries had been similarly hopeful so today he could afford to show mercy put him in the cells for now the tippoo said somewhere in the palace a frenchmade clock chimed the hour reminding the tippoo that it was time for his prayers he dismissed his entourage then went to the simple chamber where facing west towards mecca he made his daily obeisances outside cheated of their prey the tigers slunk back to the courtyards shadows one beast yawned another slept there would be other days and other men to eat that was what the six tigers lived for the days when their master was not merciful while up in the inner palace with his back to the canopied throne of gold colonel jean gudin turned the tigers handle the tiger growled the claws raked back and forth across the wooden bloodpainted flesh and the redcoat cried aloud sharpe had not meant to cry out before the punishment had begun he had been determined to show no weakness and he had even been angry with himself that he had flinched as the first blow fell but that sudden pain had been so acute that he had involuntarily shuddered since then he had closed his eyes and bitten down on the leather but in his head a silent scream shrilled as the lashes landed one after the other one hundred and twentythree bywaters shouted hoarsely the drummer boys arms were tiring but they still knew better than to slacken their efforts for sergeant hakeswill was watching and savouring every blow one hundred and twentyfour bywaters called and it was then through the silent scream that was filling his head sharpe heard a whimper then he heard another and realized that it was he who was making the noise and so he snarled instead opened his eyes and stared his loathing at the bastard officers sitting on their horses a few paces away he stared at them fixedly as if he could transfer the ghastly pain from his back onto their faces but not one of them looked at him they stared at the sky they gazed at the ground they all tried to ignore the sight of a man being beaten to death in front of their eyes one hundred and thirtysix bywaters shouted and the drummer boy beat his instrument again blood had run down sharpes back and stained the weave of his white trousers past his knees more blood had spattered onto his greased and powdered hair and still the lashes whistled down and each blow of the leather thongs splashed into the mess of broken flesh and ribboned skin and more gleaming blood spurted away one hundred and forty keep it high boy keep it high not on the kidneys bywaters snapped and the sergeant major looked across at the surgeon and saw that micklewhite was staring vaguely up over the tripods peak his jowly face looking as calm as though he was merely idling away a summers day want to look at him mister micklewhite sir the sergeant major suggested but micklewhite just shook his head keep going lads the sergeant major told the drummer boys not bothering to keep the disapproval from his voice the flogging went on hakeswill watched it with delight but most of the men stared into the sky and prayed that sharpe would not cry aloud that would be his victory even if he died in achieving it some indian troops had gathered around the hollow square to watch the flogging such punishments were not permitted in the east india company and most of the sepoys found it inexplicable that the british inflicted it upon themselves one hundred and sixtynine bywaters shouted then saw a gleam of white under a lash the gleam was instantly obscured by a trickle of blood can see a rib sir the sergeant major called to the surgeon micklewhite waved a fly away from his face and stared up at a small cloud that was drifting northwards must be some wind up there he thought and it was a pity that there was none down here to alleviate the heat a tiny droplet of blood splashed onto his blue coat and he fastidiously backed farther away one hundred and seventyfour bywaters shouted trying to imbue the bare numbers with a tone of disapproval sharpe was scarcely conscious now the pain was beyond bearing it was as if he was being burned alive and being stabbed at the same time he was whimpering with each blow but the sound was tiny scarce loud enough to be audible to the two sweating boys whose aching arms brought the lashes down again and again sharpe kept his eyes closed the breath hissed in and out of his mouth past the gag and the sweat and saliva dribbled down his chin and dripped onto the earth where his blood showed as dark splashes in the dust two hundred and one bywaters called and wondered if he dared take a sip of water from his canteen his voice was becoming hoarse stop a voice shouted two hundred and two stop the voice shouted again and this time it was as if the whole battalion had been suddenly woken from a sleep the drummer boy gave a last hesitant tap then let his hands fall to his sides as sergeant major bywaters held up his hand to stop the next stroke which was already faltering sharpe lifted up his head and opened his eyes but saw nothing but a blur the pain surged through him he whimpered then dropped his face again and a string of spittle fell slowly from his mouth colonel arthur wellesley had ridden up to the tripod for a moment shee and his aides looked at their colonel almost guiltily as though they had been caught in some illicit pastime no one spoke as the colonel edged his horse closer to the prisoner wellesley looked down sourly then put his riding crop under sharpes chin to lift up his head the colonel almost recoiled from the look of hatred he saw in the victims eyes he pulled the crop away then wiped its tip on his saddle cloth to remove the spittle the prisoner is to be cut down major shee the colonel said icily yes sir shee was nervous wondering if he had made some terrible mistake at once sir he added though he gave no orders i dislike stopping a welldeserved punishment wellesley said loudly enough for all the nearby officers to hear but private sharpe is to be taken to general harriss tent as soon as hes recovered general harris sir major shee asked in astonishment general harris was the commander of this expedition against the tippoo and what possible business could the commanding general have with a halfflogged private yes sir of course sir shee added quickly when he saw that his query had annoyed wellesley at once sir then do it wellesley snapped the colonel was a thin young man with a narrow face hard eyes and a prominently beaked nose many older men resented that the twentynineyearold wellesley was already a full colonel but he came from a wealthy and tided family and his elder brother the earl of mornington was governorgeneral of the east india companys british possessions in india so it was hardly surprising that the young arthur wellesley had risen so high so fast any officer given the money to buy promotion and lucky enough to possess relations who could put him in the way of advancement was bound to rise but even the less fortunate men who resented wellesleys privileges were forced to admit that the young colonel had a natural and chilling authority and maybe some thought even a talent for soldiering he was certainly dedicated enough to his chosen trade if that was any sign of talent wellesley nudged his horse forward and stared down as the prisoners bonds were cut loose private sharpe he spoke with utter disdain as though he dirtied himself by even addressing sharpe sharpe looked up blinked then made a guttural noise bywaters ran forward and worked the gag out of sharpes mouth freeing the pad took some manipulation for sharpe had sunk his teeth deep into the folded leather good lad now bywaters said softly good lad didnt cry did you proud of you lad the sergeant major at last managed to work the gag free and sharpe tried to spit private sharpe wellesleys disdainful voice repeated sharpe forced his head up sir the word came out as a croak sir he tried again and this time it sounded like a moan wellesleys face twitched with distaste for what he was doing youre to be fetched to general harriss tent do you understand me sharpe sharpe blinked up at wellesley his head was spinning and the pain in his body was vying with disbelief at what he heard and with rage against the army you heard the colonel boy bywaters prompted sharpe yes sir sharpe managed to answer wellesley wellesley turned to micklewhite bandage him mister micklewhite put a salve on his back whatever you think best i want him compos mentis within the hour you understand me within an hour the surgeon said in disbelief then saw the anger on his young colonels face yes sir he said swiftly within an hour sir and give him clean clothes wellesley ordered the sergeant major before giving sharpe one last withering look and spurring his horse away the last of the ropes holding sharpe to the tripod were cut away shee and the officers watched all of them wondering just what extraordinary business had caused a summons to general harriss tent no one spoke as the sergeant major plucked away the last strands of rope from sharpes right wrist then offered his own hand here lad hold onto me gendy now sharpe shook his head im all right sergeant major he said he was not but he would be damned before he showed weakness in front of his comrades and double damned before he showed it in front of sergeant hakeswill who had watched aghast as his victim was cut down from the triangle im all right sharpe insisted and he slowly pushed himself away from the tripod then tottering slighdy turned and took three steps a cheer sounded in the light company quiet captain morris snapped take names sergeant hakeswill take names sir yes sir sharpe staggered twice and almost fell but he forced himself to stand upright and then to take some steady steps towards the surgeon reporting for bandaging sir he croaked blood had soaked his trousers his back was carnage but he had recovered most of his wits and the look he gave the surgeon almost made micklewhite flinch because of its savagery come with me private micklewhite said help him help him bywaters snapped at the drummer boys and the two sweating lads dropped their whips and hurried to support sharpes elbows he had managed to remain upright but bywaters had seen him swaying and feared he was about to collapse sharpe half walked and was half carried away major shee took off his hat scratched his greying hair and then unsure what he should do looked down at bywaters it seems we have no more business today sergeant major no sir shee paused it was all so irregular dismiss the battalion sir bywaters suggested shee nodded glad to have been given some guidance dismiss them sergeant major yes sir sharpe had survived chapter it seemed airless inside general harriss tent it was a large tent as big as a parish marquee and though both its wide entrances had been brailed back there was no wind to stir the damp air trapped under the high ridge the light inside the big tent was yellowed by the canvas to the colour of urine and gave the grass underfoot a dank unhealthy look four men waited inside the tent the youngest and most nervous was william lawford who because he was a mere lieutenant and by far the most junior officer present was sitting far off to one side on a gilt chair of such spindly and fragile construction it seemed a miracle that it had survived its transport on the armys wagons lawford scarcely dared move lest he draw attention to himself and so he sat awkward and uncomfortable as the sweat trickled down his face and dripped onto the crown of his cocked hat which rested on his thighs opposite lawford and utterly ignoring the younger man sat his colonel arthur wellesley the colonel made small talk but gruffly as though he resented being forced to wait once or twice he pulled a watch from his fob pocket snapped open the lid glared at the revealed face then restored the watch to his pocket without making a comment general harris the armys commander sat behind a long table that was spread with maps the commander of the allied armies was a trim middleaged man who possessed an uncommon measure of common sense and a great deal of practical ability and both were qualities he recognized in his younger deputy colonel wellesley george harris was an affable man but now waiting in the tents yellow gloom he seemed distracted he stared at the maps he wiped the sweat from his face with a big blue handkerchief but he rarely looked up to acknowledge the stilted conversation harris was uneasy for like wellesley he did not really approve of what they were about to do it was not so much the irregularity of the action that concerned the two men for neither was hidebound but rather because they suspected that the proposed operation would fail and that two good men or rather one good man and one bad would be lost the fourth man in the tent refused to sit but instead strode up and down between the tables and the scatter of flimsy chairs it was this man who kept alive what little conversation managed to survive the tents stiff damp and airless atmosphere he jollied his companions he encouraged them he tried to amuse them though every now and then his efforts would fail and then he would stride to one of the tent doorways and stoop to peer out cant be long now he would say each time and then begin his pacing again his name was major general david baird and he was the senior and older of general harriss two deputy commanders unlike his colleagues he had discarded his uniform coat and waistcoat stripping down to a dirty muchdarned shirt and letting the braces of his breeches hang down to his knees his dark hair was damp and tousled while his broad face was so tanned that to lawfords nervous gaze baird looked more like a labourer than a general the resemblance was even more acute because there was nothing delicate or refined about david bairds appearance he was a huge scotsman tall as a giant broad shouldered and muscled like a coalheaver it had been baird who had persuaded his two colleagues to act or rather he had persuaded general harris to act much against that officers better judgement and baird frankly did not give a tinkers damn whether colonel arthur bloody wellesley approved or not baird disliked wellesley and bitterly resented the fact that the younger man had been made into his fellow secondincommand baird never a man to let his grudges simmer unspoken had protested arthur wellesleys appointment to harris if his brother wasnt governorgeneral harris youd never have promoted him not true baird harris had answered mildly wellesley has ability ability my arse hes got family baird spat we all have family not prinking english popinjay families with too much bloody money he was born in ireland poor bloody ireland then but he aint irish harris and you know it the man doesnt even drink for gods sake a little wine maybe but nothing id call a proper drink have you ever met an irishman so sober some quite a few a good number to tell the truth harris a fairminded man had answered honesdy but is inebriation such a desirable quality in a military commander experience is baird had growled hell man you and i have seen some service weve lost blood and what has wellesley lost money nothing but money while he purchased his way up to colonel mans never been in a battle he will still make a very good secondincommand and thats all that matters harris had insisted and indeed harris had been well pleased with wellesleys performance the colonels responsibilities lay mainly with the army of the nizam of hyderabad and he had proved adept at persuading that potentate to submit to harriss suggestions a task baird could never have performed even half so well for the scotsman was notorious for his hatred of all indians that hatred went back to the years baird had spent in the dungeons of the tippoo sultan in seringapatam seventeen years before in battle against the tippoos fierce father hyder ali the young david baird had been captured he and the other prisoners had been marched to seringapatam and there endured fortyfour humiliating months of hot damp hell in hyder alis cells for some of those months baird had been manacled to the wall and now the scotsman wanted revenge he dreamed of carrying his scottish claymore across the citys ramparts and cornering the tippoo and then by christ the hell of seringapatams cells would be paid back a thousandfold it was the memory of that ordeal and the knowledge that his fellow scotsman mccandless was now doomed to endure it that had persuaded baird that mccandless must be freed colonel mccandless had himself suggested how that release might be achieved for before setting out on his mission he had left a letter with david baird the letter which had instructions penned on its cover saying that it should only be opened if mccandless failed to return suggested that if the colonel should be captured and should general harris feel it was important to make an attempt to release him then a trusted man should be sent secretly into seringapatam where he should contact a merchant named ravi shekhar if any man has the resources to free me it is shekhar mccandless had written though i trust both you and the general will weigh well the risk of losing such a prized informant against whatever small advantages might be gained from my release baird had no doubts about mccandlesss worth mccandless alone knew the identities of the british agents in the tippoos service and no one in the army knew as much of the tippoo as did mccandless and baird was aware that should the tippoo ever discover mccandlesss true responsibilities then mccandless would be given to the tigers it was baird who had remembered that mccandlesss english nephew william lawford was serving in the army and baird who had persuaded lawford to enter seringapatam in an effort to free mccandless and baird who had then proposedthe mission to general harris harris had initially scorned the idea though he had unbent sufficiently to suggest that maybe an indian volunteer could be found who would stand a much greater chance of remaining undetected in the enemy capital but baird had vigorously defended his choice this is too important to be left to some blackamoor harris and besides only mccandless knows which of the bastards can be trusted me i wouldnt trust any damned one of them harris had sighed he led two armies fifty thousand men and all but five thousand of those soldiers were indians and if blackamoors could not be trusted then harris baird and everyone else was doomed but the general knew he would make no headway against bairds stubborn dislike of all indians t would like mccandless freed harris had allowed but upon my soul baird i cant see a white man living long in seringapatam we cant send a blackamoor baird had insisted theyll take money from us then go straight to the tippoo and get more money from him then you can kiss farewell to mccandless and to this shekhar fellow but why send this young man lawford harris had asked because mccandless is a secretive fellow sir more cautious than most and if he sees willie lawford then hell know that we sent him but if its some other british fellow he might think its some deserter sent to trap him by the tippoo never underestimate the tippoo harris hes a clever little bastard he reminds me of wellesley hes always thinking harris had grunted he had resisted the idea but it had still tempted him for the havildar who had survived mccandlesss illstarred expedition had returned to the army and his story suggested that mccandless had met with the man he hoped to meet and though harris did not know who that man was he did know that mccandless had been searching for the key to the tippoos city only a mission so important a mission that could guarantee success had persuaded harris to allow mccandless to risk himself and now mccandless was taken and harris was being offered a chance to fetch him back or at least to retrieve mccandlesss news even if the colonel himself could not be fetched out of the tippoos dungeons harris was not so confident of british success in the campaign that he could disregard such a windfall but how in gods name is this fellow lawford supposed to survive inside the city harris had asked easy baird had answered scornfully the tippoos only too damned eager for european volunteers so we dress young lawford in a privates uniform and he can pretend to be a deserter hell be welcomed with open arms theyll be hanging bloody flowers round his neck and giving him first choice of the bibbis harris had slowly allowed himself to be persuaded though wellesley once introduced to the idea had advised against it lawford wellesley insisted could never pass himself off as an enlisted man but wellesley had been overruled by bairds enthusiasm and so lieutenant lawford had been summoned to harriss tent where he had complicated matters by agreeing with his colonel td dearly like to help sir he had told harris but im not sure im capable of the pretence good god man baird intervened spit and swear it aint difficult it will be very difficult harris had insisted staring at the diffident lieutenant he was doubtful whether lawford had the resources to carry off the deception for the lieutenant while plainly a decent man seemed guileless then lawford had complicated matters still further i think it would be more plausible sir he suggested respectfully if i could take another man with me deserters usually run in pairs dont they and if the man is the genuine article a ranker itll be altogether more convincing makes sense makes sense baird had put in encouragingly you have a manin mind wellesley had asked coldly his name is sharpe sir lawford said theyre probably about to flog him then hell be no damned use to you wellesley said in a tone which suggested the matter was now closed ill go with no one else sir lawford retorted stubbornly addressing himself to general harris rather than to his colonel and harris was pleased to see this evidence of backbone the lieutenant it seemed was not quite so diffident as he appeared how many lashes is this fellow getting harris asked dont know sir hes standing trial now sir and if i wasnt here id be giving evidence on his behalf i doubt his guilt the argument over whether to employ sharpe had continued over a midday meal of rice and stewed goat wellesley was refusing to intervene in the court martial or its subsequent punishment declaring that such an act would be prejudicial to discipline but william lawford stubbornly and respectfully refused to take any other man it had he said to be a man he could trust we could send another officer wellesley had suggested but that idea had faltered when the difficulties of finding a reliable volunteer were explored there were plenty of men who might go but few were steady and the steady ones would be too sensible to risk their precious commissions on what wellesley scathingly called a fools errand so why are you willing to go harris had asked lawford you dont look like a fool i trust im not sir but my uncle gave me the money to purchase my commission did he by god thats damned generous and i hope im damned grateful sir grateful enough to die for him wellesley put in sourly lawford had coloured but stuck to his guns i suspect private sharpe is resourceful enough for both of us sir the decision whether or not to employ sharpe belonged in the end to general harris who privately agreed with wellesley that to spare a man his wellearned punishment was to display a dangerous laxity but at last persuaded that extraordinary measures were needed to save mccandless the general surrendered to bairds enthusiasm and so with a heavy heart harris had ordered the unfortunate sharpe fetched to the tent which was why at long last private richard sharpe limped into the wan yellow light cast through the tents high canvas he was dressed in a clean uniform but everyone in the tent could see that he was still in dreadful pain he moved stiffly and the stifihess was not just caused by the yards of bandage that circled his torso but by the agony of every movement of his body he had tried to wash the blood out of his hair and had succeeded in taking out most of the powder as well so that when colonel wellesley told him to take off his shako he appeared with curiously mottled hair i think youd better sit man general baird suggested with a glance at harris for his permission fetch that stool harris ordered sharpe then saw that the private could not bend down to pick it up baird fetched the stool is it hurting he asked sympathetically yes sir its supposed to hurt wellesley said curdy pain is the point of punishment he kept his back to sharpe pointedly demonstrating his disapproval i do not like cancelling a flogging wellesley went on to no one in particular it erodes good order once men think their sentences can be curtailed then god only knows what roguery theyll be up to he suddenly twisted in his chair and gave sharpe an icy glare if i had my way private sharpe id march you back to the triangle and finish the job i doubt private sharpe even deserved the punishment lawford dared to intervene blushing as he did the time for that sentiment lieutenant was during the court martial wellesley snapped his tone suggesting that it would have been a wasted sentiment anyway youve been lucky private sharpe wellesley said with distaste i shall announce that youve been spared the rest of your punishment as a reward for fighting well the other day did you fight well sharpe nodded killed my share of the enemy sir so im commuting your sentence and tonight damn your eyes youll reward me by deserting sharpe wondered if he had heard right decided it was best not to ask and so he looked away from the colonel composed his face and stared fixedly at the wall of the tent have you ever thought about deserting sharpe general baird asked him me sir sharpe managed to look surprised not me sir no sir never crossed my mind sir baird smiled we need a good liar for this particular service so maybe youre an excellent choice sharpe besides anyone who looks at your back will know why you wanted to desert baird liked that idea and his face betrayed a sudden enthusiasm in fact if you hadnt already conveniently had yourself flogged man we might have had to give you a few lashes anyway he smiled sharpe did not smile back instead he looked warily from one officer to the other he could see that mister lawford was nervous baird was doing his best to be friendly general harriss face was unreadable while colonel wellesley had turned away in disgust but wellesley had always been a cold fish so there was no point in trying to gain his approval baird was the man who had saved him sharpe guessed and that fitted with bairds reputation in the army the scotsman was a soldiers general a brave man and well liked by the troops baird smiled again trying to put sharpe at his ease let me explain why youre running sharpe three days ago we lost a good man a colonel mccandless the tippoos forces captured him and so far as we know they took him back to seringapatam we want you to go to that city and be captured by the tippoos forces are you understanding me this far yes sir sharpe said obediently good man now when you reach seringapatam the tippoo will want you to join his army he likes to have white men in his ranks so you wont have any trouble taking his shilling and once youre trusted your job is to find colonel mccandless and bring him out alive are you still following me now yes sir sharpe said stoically and wondered why they did not first ask him to hop over to london and steal the crown jewels bloody idiots put a bit of gold lace on a mans coat and his brain turned to mush still they were doing what he wanted them to do which was kicking him out of the army and so he sat very still very quiet and very straight not so much out of respect but because his back hurt like the very devil every time he moved you wont be going alone baird told sharpe lieutenant lawford volunteered your services and hes going as well hell pretend to be a private and a deserter and your job is to look after him yes sir sharpe said and hid his dismay that perhaps things were not going to be quite so easy after all he could not just run now not with lawford tied to his apron strings he glanced at the lieutenant who gave him a reassuring smile the thing is sharpe lawford said still smiling tm not too certain i can pass myself off as a private but theyll believe you and you can say im a new recruit a new recruit sharpe almost laughed you could no more pass the lieutenant off as a new recruit than you could pass sharpe off as an officer he had an idea then and the idea surprised him not because it was a good idea but because it implied he was suddenly trying to make this idiotic scheme work better if you said you was a company clerk sir he muttered the words too softly made shy by the presence of so many senior officers speak up man wellesley snarled it would be better sir sharpe said so loudly that he was verging on insolence if the lieutenant said he was a company clerk sir a clerk baird asked why hes got soft hands sir clean hands sir clerks dont muck about in the dirt like the rest of us and recruits sir theyre usually just as filthyhanded as the rest of us but not clerks sir harris who had been writing looked up with a faint expression of admiration put some ink on his hands sir sharpe still spoke to baird and he wont look wrong i like it sharpe indeed i do baird said well done wellesley sneered then pointedly stared through one of the tent openings as though he found the proceedings tiresome general harris looked at lawford you could manage to play the part of a disgruntled clerk lieutenant he asked oh indeed sir im sure sir lawford at last sounded confident good harris said laying down his pen the general wore a wig to hide the scar where an american bullet had torn away a scrap of his skull on bunker hill now unconsciously he lifted a corner of the wig and scratched at that old scar and i suppose once you reach the city you contact this merchant remind me of his name baird ravi shekhar sir and what if this fellow shekhar aint there harris asked or wont help there was silence after the question the sentries outside the tent moved far enough away so they could not overhear the conversation stamped up and down a dog barked you have to anticipate these things harris said mildly scratching again under his wig wellesley offered a harsh laugh but no suggestion if ravi shekhar wont help us sir baird suggested then lawford and sharpe must get themselves into mccandlesss jail then find a way of getting themselves out the scotsman turned to sharpe were you by any chance a thief before you joined up a heartbeats hesitation then sharpe nodded yes sir what kind of a thief wellesley asked in a disgusted voice as though he was astonished to discover the ranks of his battalion contained criminals and when sharpe did not answer the colonel became even more irritable a diver a scamp sharpe was surprised that his colonel even knew such slang he shook his head indignantly denying he had ever been a mere pickpocket or a highwayman i was a house boner sir he said and proper trained too he added proudly in fact he had done his share on the highway not so much holding up coaches as slicing the leather straps that held the passengers portmanteaus on the back of coaches the job was done while the coach was speeding along a road so that the noise of the hooves and wheels would hide the sound of the tumbling luggage it was a job for agile youngsters and sharpe had been good at it a house boner means he was a burglar wellesley translated for his two senior officers unable to hide his scorn baird was pleased with sharpes answers do you still have a picklock private me sir no sir but i suppose i could find one sir if i had a guinea baird laughed suspecting the true cost was nearer a shilling but he still went to his coat which was hanging from a hook on one of the tent poles and fished out a guinea which he tossed onto sharpes lap find one before tonight private sharpe he said for who knows it might be useful he turned to harris but i doubt it will come to that sir i pray it doesnt come to that for im not sure that any man even private sharpe here can escape from the tippoos dungeons the tall general turned back to sharpe i was near four years in those cells sharpe and in all that time not one man escaped not one baird paced restlessly as he remembered the ordeal the tippoos cells have barred doors with padlocks so your picklock could take care of that but when i was there we always had four jailers in the daytime and some days there were even jettis on guard jettis sir lawford asked jettis lieutenant the tippoo inherited a dozen of the bastards from his father theyre professional strongmen and their favourite trick is executing prisoners they have several ways of doing it none of them pleasant you want to know their methods no sir lawford said hurriedly blanching at the thought sharpe was disappointed but dared not ask for the details baird grimaced very unpleasant executions lieutenant he said grimly you still want to go lawford remained pale but nodded i think its worth a try sir wellesley snorted at the lieutenants foolishness but baird ignored the colonel at night the guards are withdrawn he went on but theres still a sentry just one sharpe asked just one private baird confirmed i can take care of one sentry sir sharpe boasted not this one baird said grimly because when i was there he was eight feet long if he was an inch he was a tiger sharpe a maneater and the eight foot dont count his tail he used to be put in the corridor every night so pray you dont ever end up in the tippoos cells pray that ravi shekhar will know how to get mccandless out or at the very least harris intervened pray that shekhar can discover what mccandless knows and that you can get that news out to us so thats what we want of you baird said to sharpe with a brusque cheerfulness are you willing to go man sharpe reckoned it was all idiocy and he did not much like the sound of the tiger but he knew better than to show any reluctance i reckon three is better than two thousand sir he said three baird asked puzzled three stripes are better than two thousand lashes sir if we find out what you want to know or else fetch this colonel mccandless out of jail sir can i be a sergeant he asked the question of wellesley wellesley looked enraged at sharpes presumption and for a second it was plain that he proposed to turn him down but general harris cleared his throat and mildly remarked that it sounded a reasonable suggestion to him wellesley thought about opposing the general then decided that it was most unlikely that sharpe would even survive this nonsense and so albeit reluctantly he nodded a sergeants stripes sharpe if you succeed thank you sir sharpe said baird dismissed him go with lieutenant lawford now sharpe hell tell you what to do and one other thing the scotsmans voice became urgent for gods sake man dont tell another soul what youre doing wouldnt dream of it sir sharpe said flinching as he stood up go then baird said he waited till the two men were gone then sighed a bright young fellow that sharpe he spoke to harris a rogue wellesley interjected i could provide you with a hundred others just as disreputable scum all of them and the only thing that keeps them from riot is discipline harris rapped the table to stop the squabbling of his two secondsincommand but will the rogue succeed he asked not a chance wellesley said confidently a woefully small chance baird admitted dourly then added more vigorously but even a small chance is worth it if we can get mccandless back at the risk of losing two good men harris asked one man who might become a decent officer wellesley corrected the general and one man whose loss the world wont mourn for a second but mccandless might hold the key to the city general baird reminded harris true harris said heavily then unrolled a map that had lain scrolled on the edge of his table the map showed seringapatam and whenever he gazed at it he wondered how he was to set about besieging the city lord cornwalis who had captured the city seven years before had assaulted the north side of the island and then attacked the eastern walls but harris doubted that he would be given that route again the tippoo would have been forewarned by that earlier success which meant this new assault must come from either the south or the west a dozen deserters from the enemys forces had all claimed that the west wall was in bad repair and maybe that would give harris his best chance south or west he said aloud reiterating the problem he had already discussed a score of times with his two deputies but either way gentlemen the place is crammed with guns thick with rockets and filled with infantry and well have only the one chance before the rains come just one west or south eh he stared at the map hoping against hope that mccandless could be fetched from his dungeon to offer some guidance but dial he admitted to himself was a most unlikely outcome which meant the decision would inevitably be all his to make the final decision could wait till the army was close to the city and harris had been given a chance to view the tippoos defences but once the army was ready to make camp the choice would have to be made swiftly and all things being equal harris was fairly sure which route he would choose for weeks now his instinct had been telling him where to attack but he worried that the tippoo might have foreseen the weakness in his citys defences but there was no point in wondering whether the tippoo was outfoxing him that way lay indecision and so harris tapped his quill on the map my instincts tell me to attack here gentlemen right here he was indicating the west wall across the river shallows and right through the weakest stretch of the walls it seems the obvious place he tapped the map again right here right here right where the tippoo had set his trap allah in his infinite mercy had been good to the tippoo sultan for allah in his immeasurable wisdom had revealed the existence of a merchant who was sending information to the british army the man dealt in common metals in copper tin and brass and his wagons frequently passed through one of the citys two main gates loaded with their heavy cargoes god alone knows how many such cargoes had passed out of seringapatam in the last three months but at least the gate guards had searched the right wagon the one that carried a coded letter which under interrogation the wretched merchant had admitted contained a report of the strange work that was being done in the old closed gateway of the western wall that work should have been a close secret for the only men allowed near the gateway were gudins reliable european troops and a small band of the tippoos muslim warriors whom he regarded as utterly trustworthy the merchant not surprisingly was a hindu but when his wife was brought into the interrogation room and threatened with the redhot pincers the merchant had confessed the name of the muslim soldier who had allowed himself to be suborned by the merchants gold and so much gold a strongroom filled with the metal far more than the tippoo suspected could be earned from trading in tin brass and copper it was british gold the merchant confessed given him so he could raise rebellion inside seringapatam the tippoo did not consider himself a cruel man but nor indeed did he think of himself as a gentle one he was a ruler and cruelty and mercy were both weapons of rulers any monarch who flinched from cruelty would not rule long just as any ruler who forgot mercy would soon earn hatred and so the tippoo tried to balance mercy with cruelty he did not want the reputation of being lenient any more than he wanted to be judged a tyrant and so he tried to use both mercy and cruelty judiciously the hindu merchant his confession made had pleaded for mercy but the tippoo knew this was no time to show weakness this was the time to let a shudder of horror ripple through the streets and alleys of seringapatam it was a time to let his enemies know that the price for treason was death and so both the merchant and the muslim soldier who had taken the merchants gold were now standing on the hot sand of the inner palaces courtyard where they were being guarded by two of the tippoos favoured jettis the jettis were hindus and their strength which was remarkable was devoted to their religion that amused the tippoo some hindus sought the rewards of godliness by growing their hair and fingernails others by denying themselves food still others by abjuring all earthly pleasures but the jettis did it by developing their muscles and the results the tippoo admitted were extraordinary he might disagree with their religion but he encouraged them all the same and like his father he had hired a dozen of the most impressive strongmen to amuse and serve him two of the finest now stood beneath the throneroom balcony stripped to their waists and with their vast chests oiled so that their muscles shone dark in the earlyafternoon sun the six tigers restless because they had been denied their midday meal of freshly slaughtered goat meat glared with yellow eyes from the courtyards edges the tippoo came from his prayers to the balcony where he threw open the filigree shutters so that he and his entourage could view the courtyard clearly colonel gudin was in attendance as was appah rao both men had been summoned from the city ramparts where they had been making the last preparations for the arrival of the british gun carriages were being repaired ammunition being laid down in magazines deep enough to be shielded from the fall of enemy howitzer shells while dozens of rockets were in the ready magazines on the ramparts firesteps the tippoo liked to tour his defences where he could imagine his rockets and shells searing down into the enemy ranks but now in the courtyard of his inner palace he had an even more pleasurable duty to perform he would kill traitors both men betrayed me he told colonel gudin through the interpreter and one is also a spy what would you do in france with such men colonel send them to madame guillotine your majesty the tippoo chuckled when the answer was translated he was curious about the guillotine and at one time he had thought of having such a machine built in the city he was fascinated by all things french and indeed when the revolution had swept france and destroyed the ancim regime the tippoo had for a time embraced the new ideas of liberty equality and fraternity he had erected a tree of liberty in seringapatam ordered his guards to wear the red hats of the revolution and had even ordered revolutionary declarations to be posted in the citys main streets but the fascination had not endured the tippoo had begun to fear that his people might become too fond of liberty or even infected with equality and so he had removed the tree of liberty and had the declarations torn down yet still the tippoo treasured a love of france he had never built the guillotine not for lack of funds but rather because gudin had persuaded him that the machine was a device of mercy constructed to end a criminals life with such swiftness that the victim would never even realize he was being killed it was an ingenious device the tippoo admitted but much too merciful how could such a machine deter traitors that man the tippoo now pointed to the muslim soldier who had betrayed the secrets of the gatehouse will be killed first and then his body will be fed to pigs i can think of no fate worse for a muslim and believe me colonel he fears the pigs more than he fears his death the other man will feed my tigers and his bones will be ground to powder and delivered to his widow their deaths will be short not perhaps as quick as your machine colonel but still mercifully short he clapped his hands and the two chained prisoners were dragged forward until they stood in the centre of the courtyard the muslim soldier was forced to his knees his tigerstriped uniform had been stripped from him and now he wore nothing but a short pair of loose cotton breeches he stared up at the tippoo who was gaudy in a yellow silk tunic and a jewelled turban and the man raised his manacled hands in a mute appeal for clemency that the tippoo ignored gudin tensed himself he had seen the jettis at work before but familiarity did not make the spectacle any more pleasant the first jetti placed a nail on the crown of the victims bare head the nail was of black iron and had a sixinch shank that was topped by a flat head that was a good three inches wide the man held the nail in place with his left hand then looked up at the balcony the doomed soldier feeling the touch of the iron point on his scalp called for forgiveness the tippoo listened for a second to the soldiers desperate excuses then pointed a finger at him the tippoo held the finger steady for a few seconds and the soldier held his breath as he dared to believe he might be forgiven but then the tippoos hand abruptly dropped the jetti raised his right hand its palm facing downwards then took a deep breath he paused summoning his huge strength then he slapped the hand fast down so that his open palm struck the nails flat top he shouted aloud as he struck and at the very instant that his right hand slapped the nail so he snatched his left hand away from the long shank which was driven hard and deep into the soldiers skull it went so deep that the nails flat head crushed the prisoners black hair blood spurted from under the nail as its shank slammed home the jetti stepped away gesturing at the nail as if to show how much strength had been needed to so drive it through the thick bone of the skull the traitor still lived he was babbling and shrieking and blood was spilling down his face in quick lacing rivulets as he swayed on his knees his body was shaking but then quite suddenly his back arched he stared wideeyed up at the tippoo and then fell forward his body shuddered twice then was still one of the six chained tigers stirred at the smell of blood and padded forward until its chain stretched to its full length and so held it back the beast growled then settled down to watch the second man die the tippoo and his entourage applauded the first jettfs skill then the tippoo pointed at the wretched hindu merchant this second prisoner was a big man fat as butter and his gross size would only make the second demonstration all the more impressive the first jetti his execution successfully completed fetched a stool from the gateway he set it down and forced the fat weeping merchant onto its seat then he knelt in front of the chair and pinned the mans manacled arms down tight against his sagging belly so that he could not move the chair faced the tippoo and the kneeling jetti made certain he stayed low so that he would not spoil his masters view it takes more strength than you would think the tippoo remarked to gudin to drive a nail into a skull so your majesty has been kind enough to inform me before gudin answered drily the tippoo laughed you do not enjoy this colonel the death of traitors is ever necessary sire gudin said evasively but i should like to think you derive amusement from it surely you appreciate my mens strength i do admire it sire then admire it now the tippoo said for the next death takes even more strength than the nail the tippoo smiled and turned back to look into the courtyard where the second jetti waited behind the prisoner the tippoo pointed at the merchant held the gesture as before then dropped his hand abruptly the merchant screamed in anticipation then began to shake like a leaf as the jetti placed his hands against the sides of the merchants skull his touch was gentle at first almost a caress his palms covered the merchants ears as his fingers groped to find a purchase among the skull bones beneath the victims fat cheeks then the jetti suddenly tightened his grip distorting the plump face and the merchants scream became frantic until at last he had no breath left to scream and could only mew in terror the jetti drew breath paused to concentrate all his force then gave a great shout that made the six tigers leap to their feet in alarm as he shouted the jetti twisted the merchants head he was wringing his victims neck like a man would wring a chickens gullet only this neck was thick and fat but thejettfs first great effort twisted it so far around that the face was already looking back across its right shoulder when the executioner made his second effort marked by a grunt which pulled the head all the way around and gudin flinching from the sight on the balcony heard the distinct crack as the merchants spine was broken the jetti let go of the head and sprang back proud of his work as the dead merchant collapsed off the stool the tippoo applauded then tossed down two small bags of gold take that one to the pigs he said pointing at the muslim and leave the other here let the tigers loose the balcony shutters were closed somewhere deep in the palace perhaps from the harem where the tippoos six hundred wives concubines and handmaidens all lived a harp tinkled prettily while down in the courtyard the tigers keepers used their long staves to herd the beasts as they released them from their chains the tippoo smiled at his followers back to the walls gentlemen he said we have work to do the keepers released the last tiger then followed the jettis out through the gateway the dead soldier had been dragged away for a moment the tigers watched the remaining body then one of the beasts crossed to the merchants corpse and eviscerated the fat belly with one blow of its huge paw and so ravi shekhar had died and now was eaten sharpe was back with his company before sunset he was greeted ebulliendy by men who saw in his release from the flogging a small victory for the lower ranks against blind authority private mallinson even clapped sharpe on the back and was rewarded with a stream of curses sharpe ate with his usual six companions who as ever were joined by three wives and by mary the supper was a stew of beans rice and salt beef and it was at the end of the small meal when they were sharing a canteen of arrack that sergeant hakeswill appeared private sharpe he was carrying a cane that he pointed towards sharpe i wants you sergeant sharpe acknowledged hakeswill but did not move a word with you private on your feet now sharpe still did not move im excused company duties sergeant colonels orders hakeswills face wrenched itself in a grotesque twitch this aint your duty the sergeant said this is your bleeding pleasure so get on your bloody feet and come here sharpe obediently stood flinching as his coat tugged at his grievously wounded back he followed the sergeant to an open space behind the surgeons tent where hakeswill turned and rammed his cane into sharpes chest how the hell did you escape that flogging sharpie sharpe ignored the question hakeswills broken nose was still swollen and bruised and sharpe could see the worry in the sergeants eyes didnt you hear me boy hakeswill shoved the canes tip into sharpes belly how come you was cut down how come you were cut down from the scaffold sergeant sharpe asked no lip from you boy no lip or by god ill have you strapped to the tripod again now tell me what the general wanted sharpe shook his head tf you want to know that sergeant he said youd better ask general harris yourself stand still stand straight hakeswill snapped then cut with his cane at a nearby guy rope he sniffed wondering how best to worm the information out of sharpe and decided for a change to try gentleness i admire you sharpie the sergeant said hoarsely not many men have the guts to walk after getting two hundred tickles of the whip takes a strong man to do that sharpie and id hate to see you getting even more tickles its in your best interest to tell me sharpie you know that itll go bad with you else so why was you released lad sharpe pretended to relent you know why i was released sergeant he said the colonel announced it no i dont know lad hakeswill said upon my soul i dont so you tell me now sharpe shrugged because we fought well the other day sergeant its a reward like no it bleeding aint hakeswill shouted then dodged to one side and slashed his cane onto sharpes wounded back sharpe almost screamed with the pain you dont get called away to a generals tent for that sharpie hakeswill said stands to reason never heard nothing like it in all my born days so you tell me why you bastard sharpe turned to face his persecutor you lay that cane on me again obadiah he said softly and ill tell general harris about you ill have you skinned of your stripes i will and turned back into a private would you like that obadiah you and me in the same file id like that obadiah stand still hakeswill spat shut your face sergeant sharpe said he had called hakeswills bluff and there was pleasure in that the sergeant had doubtless thought he could bully the truth out of sharpe but sharpe held all the trump cards here hows your nose he asked hakeswill be careful sharpie be careful oh i am sergeant i am im real careful have you done now sharpe did not wait for an answer but just walked away the next time he faced obadiah he thought he would have the stripes on his sleeve and god help hakeswill then he talked to mary for half an hour then it was time to make the excuses that lieutenant lawford had rehearsed with him he picked up his pack took his musket and said he had to report to the paymasters tent tm on light duties till the stripes heal he told his mates doing sentrygo on the money ill see you tomorrow major general baird had made all the arrangements the camps western perimeter was guarded by men he could trust and those men had orders to disregard anything they saw while next day baird promised lawford the army would take care not to send any cavalry patrols directly west in case those patrols discovered the two fugitives your job is to go as far west as you can tonight baird told sharpe and lawford when he met them close to the western picquet line and then keep walking west in the morning you understand now yes sir lawford answered the lieutenant beneath a heavy cloak that disguised his uniform was now dressed in the common soldiers red wool coat and white trousers sharpe had tugged lawfords hair back then wrapped it round the learner pad to form the queue and after that he had smothered it with a mix of grease and powder so that lawford looked no different from any other private except that his hands were still too soft but at least they now had ink under the fingernails and ground into the pores lawford had grimaced as sharpe had tugged at his hair and protested when sharpe had gouged two marks in his neck where a stock would have scraped twin calluses but baird had hushed him lawford winced again when he put on the leather stock and realized just what discomfort the ordinary soldier endured daily now safe out of sight of the soldiers about their campfires he dropped the cloak pulled on a pack and picked up his musket baird hauled a huge watch from his pocket and tilted its face to the half moon eleven oclock the general said time you fellows were away he put two fingers in his mouth and sounded a shrill quick whistle and the picquet visible in the pale moonlight magically parted north and south to leave an unguarded gap in the camps perimeter baird had shaken lawfords hand then patted sharpes shoulder hows your back sharpe hurts like hell sir it did too baird looked worried youll manage though i aint soft sir t never supposed you were private baird patted sharpes shoulder again then gestured into the dark off you go lads and god be with you baird watched the two men run across the open ground and disappear into the darkness on the farther side he waited for a long time hoping to catch a last glimpse of the two mens shadows but he saw nothing and his best judgement suggested that he would probably never see either soldier again and that reflection saddened him he sounded the whistle again and watched as the sentries reformed the picquet line then he turned and walked slowly back to his tent this way sharpe lawford said when they were out of earshot of the sentries were following a star just like the wise men bill sharpe said it had taken sharpe an extraordinary effort to use mister lawfords first name but he knew he had to do it his survival and lawfords depended on everything being done right but the use of the name shocked lawford who stopped and stared at sharpe what did you call me i called you bill sharpe said because thats your bleeding name you aint an officer now youre one of us im dick youre bill and we aint following any bloody star were going to those trees over there see the three big buggers sharpe lawford protested no sharpe turned savagely on lawford my job is to keep you alive bill so get one thing straight youre a bleeding private now not a bloody officer you volunteered remember and were deserters there aint no ranks here no sirs no bloody salutes no gentlemen when we get back to the army i promise you ill pretend this never happened and ill salute you till my bloody arm drops off but not now and not till you and me get out of this bloody nonsense alive so come on lawford stunned by sharpes confidence meekly followed but this is south of west he protested glancing up at the stars to check the direction sharpe was taking well go west later sharpe said now get your bleeding stock off he ripped his own off and tossed it into some bushes first thing any runner does sir the sir was accidental a habit and he silently cursed himself for using it is take off his stock then mess your hair and get those trousers dirty you look like youre standing guard on windsor bleeding castle sharpe watched as lawford did his best to obey so where did you join up bill he asked lawford was still resentful of this sudden reversal of roles but he was sensible enough to realize sharpe was right join up he repeated i didnt of course you did where did they recruit you my homes near portsmouth thats no bloody good navy would press you in portsmouth before a recruiting sergeant could get near to you ever been to sheffield good lord no lawford sounded horrified good place sheffield sharpe said and theres a pub on pond street called the hawle in the pond can you remember that the hawle in the pond in sheffield its a favourite hunting hole for the rds recruiters especially on market days you was tricked there by some bleeding sergeant he got you drunk and before you knew it youd taken the kings shilling he was a sergeant of the rd so what did he have on his bayonet his bayonet lawford fumbling to release the leather binding of his newly clubbed hair frowned in perplexity nothing i should hope were the rd bill the havercakes he carried an oatcake on his bayonet remember and he promised youd be an officer inside two years because he was a lying bastard what did you do before you met him lawford shrugged a farmer no one would ever believe you laboured on a farm sharpe said scornfully you aint got a farmers arms that general baird now hes got proper arms looks as if he could hoist hay all day long and not feel a damn thing but not you you were a lawyers clerk lawford nodded i think we should go now he said trying to reassert his rapidly vanishing authority were waiting sharpe said stubbornly so why the hell are you running lawford frowned unhappiness i suppose bleeding hell youre a soldier you aint supposed to be happy no lets think now you boned the captains watch how about that got caught and you faced a flogging you saw me flogged and didnt fancy you could survive so you and me being mates like ran i really do think we must go lawford insisted in a minute sir again sharpe cursed himself for using the honorific just let my back settle down oh of course lawford was immediately contrite but we cant wait too long sharpe dick sir you call me dick were friends remember of course lawford as uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy as with the need to waste time settled awkwardly by sharpe at the base of a tree so why did you join up he asked sharpe the harmen were after me the harmen oh yes the constables lawford paused somewhere in the night a creature shrieked as it was caught by a predator while off to the east the sergeants called to their sentries the sky glowed with the light of the armys myriad fires what had you done lawford asked killed a man put a knife in him lawford gazed at sharpe murdered him you mean oh aye it was murder right enough even though the bugger deserved it but the judge at york assizes wouldnt have seen it my way would he which meant dick sharpe would have been morrisdancing at the end of a rope so i reckoned it was easier to put on the scarlet coat the harmen dont bother a man once hes in uniform not unless he killed one of the gentry lawford hesitated not sure whether he should enquire too deeply then decided it was worth a try so who was the fellow you killed bugger kept an inn i worked for him see it was a coaching inn so he knew what coaches were carrying good baggage and my job was to snaffle the stuff once the coach was on the road that and some prigging lawford did not like to ask what prigging was so kept quiet he were a right bastard sharpe went on but that wasnt why i stuck him it was over a girl see and he and i had a disagreement about who should keep her blanket warm he lost and im here and god knows where the lass is now he laughed were wasting time lawford said quiet sharpe snapped then picked up his musket and pointed it towards some bushes is that you lass its me richard mary bickerstaff emerged from the shadows carrying a bundle evening mr lawford sir she said shyly call him bill sharpe insisted then stood and shouldered his musket come on bill he said no point in wasting time here theres three of us now and wise men always travel in threes dont they so find your bleeding star and lets be moving they walked all night following lawfords star towards the western skyline lawford took sharpe aside at one point and insisting on his evermore precarious authority ordered sharpe to send the woman back thats an order sharpe lawford said she wont go sharpe retorted we cant take a woman lawford snapped why not deserters always take their valuables sir bill i mean christ private if you mess this up ill make sure you get all the stripes you escaped yesterday sharpe grinned it wont be me who messes it its the damn fool idea itself nonsense lawford strode ahead forcing sharpe to follow mary guessing that they were arguing about her kept a few paces behind theres nothing wrong with general bairds notion lawford said we fall into the tippoos hands we join his wretched army find this man ravi shekhar then leave everything to him and just what part does mrs bickerstaff play in that he asked the question angrily whatever part she wants sharpe said stubbornly lawford knew he should argue or rather that he should impose his authority on sharpe but he sensed he could never win he was beginning to wonder whether it had been such a good idea to bring sharpe after all but from the first moment when baird had suggested this desperate endeavour lawford had known he would need help and he had also known which of the light companys soldiers he wanted private sharpe had always stood out not just because of his height but because he was by far the quickestwilted man in the company but even so lawford had not been ready for the speed or force with which sharpe had taken over this mission lawford had expected gratitude from sharpe and also deference he even believed he deserved that deference purely by virtue of being an officer but sharpe had swiftly torn that assumption into tatters it was rather as if lawford had harnessed a solidlooking draught horse to his gig only to discover it was a runaway racer but why had the racehorse insisted on bringing the filly that offended lawford suggesting to him that sharpe was taking advantage of the freedom offered by this mission lawford glanced at sharpe noting how pale and strained he looked and he guessed that the flogging had taken far more from the private than he realized i still think mrs bickerstaff should go back to the army he said gently she cant sharpe said curtly tell him mary mary ran to catch up tm not safe while hakeswills alive she told lawford you could have been looked after lawford suggested vaguely who by mary asked a man looks after a woman in the army and he wants his price you know that sir call him bill sharpe snarled our lives might depend on it if one of us calls him sir then theyll feed us to their bloody tigers and it isnt just hakeswill mary went on sergeant green wants to marry me now which is at least more than hakeswill does but i dont want either i just want to be left in peace with richard god knows lawford said bitterly but youve probably jumped out of the frying pan into the fire til take my chances mary said obstinately though she had taken what care she could to reduce her chances of being raped she had dressed herself in a torn dark frock and a filthy apron both garments as drab and greasy as she could find she had smeared ashes and dirt into her hair but she had done nothing to disguise the lively beauty in her face besides she said to lawford neither you nor richard speak any of the languages you need me and i brought some more food she hoisted the cloth bundle lawford grunted behind them the horizon was now marked with a pale glow that silhouetted trees and bushes he guessed they had travelled about a dozen miles and as the pale glow turned brighter and the dawns light seeped across the landscape he suggested they stop and rest marys bundle held a halfdozen loaves of flat unleavened bread and had two canteens of water which they shared as their breakfast after he had eaten lawford went into the bushes for privacy and as he came back he saw sharpe hit mary hard in the face for gods sake man lawford shouted what are you doing blacking my eye mary answered i asked him to dear god lawford said marys left eye was already swelling and tears were running down her cheeks whatever for keep the buggers off her of course sharpe said are you all right love ill live mary said you hit hard richard no point in hitting softly didnt mean to hurt you though mary splashed water on her eye then they all started walking again they were now in an open stretch of country that was dotted with groves of brightblossomed trees there were no villages in sight though they did come to an aqueduct an hour after dawn and wasted another hour trying to find a way across before simply plunging into the weedfilled water and wading through seringapatam lay well below the horizon but lawford knew the city was almost due west and he planned to angle southwards until he reached the cauvery and then follow that river to the city the lieutenants spirits were low he had volunteered for this mission readily enough but in the night it had begun to dawn on him just how risky the errand was he felt lonely too he was only two years older than sharpe and he envied sharpe marys companionship and he still resented the privates lack of deference he did not dare express that resentment for he knew it would be scorned but nor did he really wish to express it for he had discovered that he wanted sharpes admiration rather than his deference lawford wanted to prove that he was as tough as the private and that desire kept him stoically walking on towards the horrid unknown sharpe was equally worried he liked lawford but suspected he would have to work hard to keep the lieutenant out of trouble he was a quick study the lieutenant but so ignorant of the worlds ways that he could easily betray the fact that he was no common soldier as for the tippoo he was an unknown danger but sharpe was canny enough to know that he would have to do whatever the tippoos men wanted he worried about mary too he had persuaded her to come on this fools errand and she had not taken much persuading but now she was here sharpe was concerned that he could not protect both her and lawford but despite his worries he still felt free he was after all off the armys leash and he reckoned he could survive so long as lawford made no mistake and if sharpe survived he knew how to prosper the rules were simple trust no one be ever watchful and if trouble came hit first and hit hard it had worked for him so far mary too had doubts she had persuaded herself she was in love with sharpe but she sensed a restlesness in him that made her think he might not always be in love with her still she was happier here than back with the army and that was not just because of sergeant hakeswills threat but because although the army was the only life mary had ever known she sensed the world could offer her more she had grown up in calcutta and though her mother had been indian mary had never felt at home in either the army or in india she was neither one thing nor the other to the army she was a bibbi while to the indians she was outside their castes and she was acceptable to neither she was a halfbreed suspended in a purgatory of distrust with only her looks to help her survive and though the army was the place that provided the friendliest company it hardly offered a secure future ahead of her stretched a succession of husbands each one succeeding as the previous one was killed in battle or else died of a fever and when she was too old to attract another man she would be left with her children to fend as best she could mary just like sharpe wanted to find some way up and out of that fate but how she was to do it she did not know though this expedition at least gave her a chance to break temporarily out of the trap lawford led them to a slight hill from where screened by flowering bushes he scanned the country ahead he thought he could see a gleam of water to the south and the small glimpse was sufficient to persuade him that it must be the river cauvery that way he said but well have to avoid the villages there were two in sight both barring the direct path to the river the villagers will see us anyway mary said they dont miss much were not here to trouble them lawford said so perhaps theyll leave us alone turn our coats bill sharpe suggested turn our coats were running arent we so put your coat on back to front as a sign that youre on the run the villagers will hardly realize the significance of that lawford observed tartly bugger the villagers sharpe said its the tippoos bloody men im worried about if those bastards see red coats theyll shoot before they ask questions sharpe had already undone his crossbelts and was shrugging off the wool coat grunting with the pain that the exertion gave to his back lawford watching saw that blood had seeped through the thick bandages to stain the dirty shirt lawford was reluctant to turn his coat a turned coat was a sign of disgrace battalions that had let the army down in battle were sometimes forced to turn their coats as a badge of shame but once again the lieutenant saw the wisdom of sharpes argument and so he stripped and turned his coat so that its grey lining was outermost maybe we shouldnt carry the muskets he suggested no deserter would throw away his gun sharpe answered he buckled his belt over the turned coat and picked up his gun and pack he had carried the pack in his hand all night rather than have its weight press on his wounds are you ready in a moment lawford said then to sharpes surprise the lieutenant went on one knee and said a silent prayer i dont pray often lawford admitted as he stood but maybe some help from on high would be providential today for today lawford guessed would be the day they would meet die tippoos patrols they walked south towards the gleam of water all three were tired and sharpe was plainly weakened by the loss of blood but anticipation gave them all a nervous energy they skirted the nearest village watched by cows with pendulous folds of skin hanging beneath their necks then they walked through groves of cocoa trees as the sun climbed they saw no one a deer skittered away from their path in the late morning and an hour later an excited troupe of small monkeys scampered beside diem at midday they rested in the small shade offered by a grove of bamboos then pressed on again beneath the baking sun by early afternoon the river was in sight and lawford suggested they should rest on its bank marys eye had swollen and blackened giving her the grotesque look she believed would protect her t could do with a rest now sharpe admitted the pain was terrible and every step was now an agony and i need to wet the bandages wet them lawford asked thats what that bastard micklewhite said said to keep the bandages damp or else the stripes wont heal well wet them at the river lawford promised but they never reached the river bank they were walking beside some beech trees when a shout sounded behind them and sharpe turned to see horsemen coming from the west they were finelooking men in tigerstriped tunics and with spiring brass helmets who couched their lances and galloped hard towards the three fugitives sharpes heart pounded he stepped ahead of his companions and held up a hand to show they meant no harm but the leading lancer only grinned in reply and lowered his lance point as he pricked back his spurs sharpe shook his head and waved then realized the man intended to skewer the spear into his belly bastard sharpe shouted and dropped his pack and put both hands on his musket as though it was a quarterstaff mary screamed in terror no lawford shouted at the galloping lancers no the lancer thrust his blade at sharpe who knocked the spear point aside with the muzzle of the gun then swung the gun fast back so that its butt smacked hard onto the horses head the beast whinnied and reared throwing its rider backwards the other lancers laughed then sawed their reins to swerve past the fallen man mary was shouting at them in a language sharpe did not understand lawford was waving his hands desperately but the lancers bored on in concentrating on sharpe who stepped backwards from their wickedlooking spear points he slashed a second lance aside then a third man rammed his spurs back and attempted to drive his spear hard into sharpes belly sharpe half managed to edge away from the blow and instead of skewering his stomach the lance sliced through the skin of his waist through his coat and into the tree behind him the lancer left his spear buried in the beech and wheeled his horse away sharpe was pinned to the bark his back a sheet of agony where it was forced against the tree he tugged at the lance but his loss of blood had made him far too weak and the weapon would not budge and then another lancer spurred towards him with his spear point aimed at sharpes eyes mary shouted frantically the spear point paused an inch from sharpes left eyeball the lancer looked at mary grimaced at her filthy state then said something mary answered the lancer who was evidently an officer looked back to sharpe and seemed to be debating whether to kill or to spare him finally he grinned leaned down and grasped the spear pinning sharpe to the tree he dragged it free sharpe swore foully then collapsed at the foot of the tree there were a score of horsemen and they all now gathered around the fugitives two of them held their razorsharp lances at lawfords neck while the officer spoke to mary she answered defiantiy and to sharpe who was struggling to stand it seemed that the conversation went on for a long time nor did the lancers seem friendly they were magnificentlooking men and sharpe despite his pain noted how well they maintained their weapons there was no rust on the lance heads and the shafts were oiled smooth mary argued with the officer and he seemed indifferent to her pleading but at last she must have made her point for she turned and looked at lawford he wants to know if youre willing to serve in the tippoos forces she told the lieutenant the lance tips were tickling lawfords neck and as a recruiting device they worked wonders the lieutenant nodded eagerly absolutely he said just what we want volunteers tell him were ready to serve both of us long live the tippoo the officer did not need the enthusiastic reply translated he smiled and ordered his lancers to take their weapons from the redcoats neck and thus sharpe joined the enemys army chapter sharpe was near to exhausted despair by the time he reached the city the lancers had driven the three fugitives westwards at an unrelenting pace but had offered none of them a saddle and so the three had walked and by the time he stumbled through the ford that took them south across the cauvery to the island on which seringapatam was built sharpes back burned like a sheet of fire the city itself still lay a mile to the west but the whole island had been ringed with new earthworks inside which thousands of refugees were gathered the refugees had brought their livestock obedient to the tippoos orders that all food stocks should be denied to the slowly advancing british army a halfmile from the city wall a second earthwork had been thrown up to protect a sprawling encampment of thatched mudbrick barracks in which thousands of the tippoos infantry and cavalry lived none of the troops was idle some were drilling others were heightening the mud wall around the encampment and still more were firing their muskets at targets of straw men propped against the citys stone wall the straw men were all dressed in makeshift red coats and lawford watched aghast as the muskets knocked the targets over or else exploded great chunks from their strawstuffed torsos the soldiers families lived inside the encampment and the women and children flocked to see the two white men pass they assumed sharpe and lawford were prisoners and some jeered as they went by and others laughed when sharpe staggered in pain keep going sharpe lawford said encouragingly gall me dick for christs sake sharpe snapped keep going dick lawford managed to say albeit angrily for having been reproved by the private not far now mary said in sharpes ear she was helping sharpe walk though at times when the jeering became raucous she clung to sharpe for support ahead of them were the city walls and lawford seeing them wondered how anyone could hope to blast through such massive works the great ramparts were limewashed so that they seemed to shine in the sun and lawford could see cannon muzzles showing in every embrasure cavaliers jutting out like small square bastions had been built everywhere along the face of the wall so that yet more guns could be brought to bear on any attacker above the walls on which the tippoos flags stirred in the small warm wind the twin white minarets of the citys mosque towered in the sunlight beyond the minarets lawford could see the intricate tower of a hindu temple its stone layers elaborately carved and gorgeously painted while just north of the temple there shone the gleaming green tiles of what lawford supposed was the tippoos palace the city was all much bigger and grander than lawford had expected while the whitepainted wall was higher and stronger than he had ever feared he had expected a mud wall but as he drew closer to the ramparts he could see that these eastern walls were made from massive stone blocks that would need to be chipped away by the siege guns if a breach were ever to be made in places where the wall had been damaged by previous sieges there were patches where the stone had been repaired by brickwork but nowhere did the wall look weak it was true that the city had not had time to build itself a modern european type of defence with starshaped walls and outlying forts and awkward bastions and confusing ravelins but even so the place looked dauntingly strong and even now vast antlike gangs of labourers some of them naked in the heat were carrying baskets of deepred earth on their backs and piling the soil to heighten the glacis that lay directly in front of the limewashed walls the growing earthen glacis that was separated from the walls by a ditch that could be flooded with river water was designed to deflect the besiegers shots up and over the ramparts lawford consoled himself that lord cornwallis had managed to smash into this formidable city seven years before but the heightening of the glacis demonstrated that the tippoo had learned from that defeat and suggested that general harris would not find it nearly so easy the lancers ducked their spired helmets as they clattered through the tunnel of the citys bangalore gate and so led the fugitives into the stinking tangle of crowded streets the spears forged the lancers path driving civilians aside and forcing wagons and handcarts into hasty retreats up any convenient alley even the sacred cows that wandered freely inside the city were forced aside though the lancers did it gently not wanting to offend the sensibilities of the hindus they passed the mosque then turned down a street lined with shops their open fronts thickly hung with cloth silk silver jewellery vegetables shoes and hides in one alley lawford caught a glimpse of bloodsoaked men butchering two camels and the sight almost made him gag a naked child hurled a bloody camels tail at the two white men and soon a horde of tattered chanting children were dodging through the lancers horses to mock the prisoners and pelt them with animal dung sharpe cursed them lawford hunched low as he walked and the children only ran away when two european soldiers both dressed in bluejackets chased them away prisonniers one of the two men called cheerfully non monsieur lawford answered in his best schoolboy french nous sommes deserteurs cest bonl the man tossed lawford a mango lafemme aussi lafemme est notre prisonniere lawford tried a little wit and was rewarded with a laugh and a farewell shout of bonne chance you speak french sharpe asked a little lawford claimed modestly really only a little bloody amazing sharpe said and lawford was obscurely pleased that he had at last succeeded in impressing his companion bet not many private soldiers speak frog sharpe dashed lawfords pleasure so dont show yourself as being too good at it stick to bloody english i didnt think of that lawford said ruefully he looked at the mango as though he had never seen such a piece of fruit before and it was plain that his hunger was tempting him to bite into the sweet flesh but then his manners prevailed and he gallantly insisted that mary eat the fruit instead the lancers turned into a delicately sculpted archway where two sentries stood guard once inside the archway the cavalrymen slid down from their saddles and lances in hand led their horses down a narrow passage between two high brick walls sharpe mary and lawford were more or less abandoned just inside the gateway where the two sentries ignored them but did chase away the more curious townsfolk who had gathered to stare at the europeans sharpe sat on a mounting block and tried to ignore the pain in his back then the lancer officer returned and shouted at them to follow him he led them through another arch then under an arcade where flowers twined round pillars and so to a guardroom the officer said something to mary then locked the door he says were to wait mary said she still had the mango and though the lancers had stripped sharpe and lawford of their coats and packs and had searched the two men for coins and hidden weapons they had not searched mary and she took a small folding penknife from an inside pocket of her skirt and cut the fruit into three portions lawford ate his share then wiped juice from his chin did you ever get that picklock sharpe he asked saw sharpes furious glare and coloured dick he corrected himself had it all along sharpe said marys got it and shes got the guinea he grinned despite his pain you mean you lied to general baird lawford asked sternly course i bloody lied sharpe snarled what kind of a fool admits to having a picklock for a moment lawford looked as though he would reprove sharpe for dishonesty but the lieutenant controlled the urge he merely shook his head in mute disapproval then sat with his back against the bare brick wall the floor was made of small green tiles on which sharpe lay on his belly in minutes he was asleep mary sat beside him sometimes stroking his hair and lawford found himself embarrassed by her display of affection he felt he ought to talk with mary but found he had nothing to say and so decided it was better not to speak in case he woke sharpe he waited somewhere deep in the palace a fountain splashed once there was a great clatter of hooves as cavalrymen led their horses out from the inner stables but most of the time it was quiet in the room it was also blessedly cool sharpe woke after dark he groaned as the pains in his back registered and mary hushed him what time is it love sharpe asked her late jesus sharpe said as a stab of agony tore down his spine he sat up whimpering with the effort and tried to prop himself against the wall a wan moonlight came through the small barred window and mary in its dim light could see the bloodstains spreading through the bandages and onto sharpes shirt have they forgotten us sharpe asked no mary said they brought us some water while you were asleep here she lifted the jug towards him and they gave us a bucket she gestured across the dim cell for she faltered i can smell what the buckets for sharpe said he took the jug and drank lawford was slumped against the far wall and there was a small open book face down on the floor beside the sleeping lieutenant sharpe grimaced glad the buggers brought something useful he said to mary you mean this lawford said indicating the book he had not been asleep after all sharpe wished he had not used the insult but did not know how to retrieve it what is it he asked instead a bible bloody hell sharpe said you dont approve lawford asked icily i had a bellyful of the good book when i was in the foundlings home sharpe said if they werent reading it to us they were hitting us round the head with it and it wasnt some litde book like that one but a bloody great big thick thing could have stunned an ox that bible did they teach you to read it lawford asked we werent reckoned good enough to read good enough to pick hemp we were but not read no they just read it to us at breakfast it was the same every morning cold porridge tin of water and an earful of abraham and isaac so you cant read lawford asked of course i cant read sharpe laughed scornfully what the bloody hells the use of reading dont be a fool dick lawford said patiently only a fool takes pride in pretending that a skill he doesnt possess is worthless for a second lawford was tempted to launch himself on a panegyric of reading how it would open a new world to sharpe a world of drama and story and information and poetry and timeless wisdom then he thought better of it you want your sergeants stripes dont you he asked instead a man doesnt have to read to be a sergeant sharpe said stubbornly no but it helps and youll be a better sergeant if you can read otherwise the company clerks tell you what the reports say and what the lists say and what the punishment book says and the quartermasters will rob you blind but if you can read then youll know when theyre lying to you there was a long silence somewhere in the palace a sentrys footsteps echoed off stone then came a sound so familiar that it almost made lawford weep for homesickness it was a clock striking the hour twelve oclock midnight is it hard sharpe finally asked learning to read lawford said not really then you and mary had better teach me bill hadnt you yes lawford said yes we had they were taken out of the guardroom in the morning four tigerstriped soldiers fetched them and pushed them down the arcade then into a narrow corridor that seemed to run beside the kitchens and afterwards through a shadowed tangle of stables and storerooms that led to a double gate which opened into a large courtyard where the bright sun made them blink then sharpes eyes adjusted to the brilliant daylight and he saw what waited for them in the courtyard and he swore there were six tigers all of them huge beasts with yellow eyes and dirty teeth the animals stared at the three newcomers then one of the tigers rose arched its back shook himself and slowly padded towards them jesus christ sharpe said but just then the tigers chain lifted from the dusty ground stretched taut and the tiger cheated of its breakfast growled and went back to the shadows another beast scratched itself a third yawned look at the size of the bastards shaipe said just big pussy cats lawford said with an insouciance he did not entirely feel then you go and scratch their chins sharpe said and see if they purr bugger off you this was to another curious beast that was straining towards him from the end of its chain need a big mouse to feed one of those bastards the tigers cant reach you a voice spoke in english from behind them unless their keepers release them from their chains good morning sharpe turned a tall middleaged officer with a black moustache had come into the courtyard he was a european and wore the blue uniform of france i am colonel gudin the officer said and you are for a moment none of them spoke then lawford straightened to attention william lawford sir his names bill sharpe said im called dick and this is my woman he put an arm round marys shoulder gudin grimaced as he looked at marys swollen black eye and her filthy skirts you have a name he paused mademoiselle he finally decided that was the most appropriate way to address mary mary sir she made a small curtsey and gudin returned the courtesy with an inclination of his head and your name he asked sharpe sharpe sir dick sharpe and you are deserters the colonel asked with a measure of distaste yes sir lawford said i am never certain that deserters are to be trusted gudin said mildly he was accompanied by a burly french sergeant who kept giving the tigers nervous glances if a man can betray one flag gudin observed why not another a man might have good reason to betray his flag sir sharpe said defiantly and your reason sharpe sharpe turned round so that the blood on his back was visible he let gudin stare at the stains then turned back is that good enough sir gudin shuddered i never understand why the british flog their soldiers it is barbarism he waved irritably at the flies which buzzed about his face sheer barbarism you dont flog in the french army sir of course not gudin said scornfully he put a hand on sharpes shoulder and turned him around again when was this done to you couple of days ago sir have you changed the bandages no sir wetted them though youll still be dead in a week unless we do something gudin said then turned and spoke to the sergeant who walked briskly out of the courtyard gudin turned sharpe around again so what had you done to deserve such barbarism private sharpe nothing sir beyond nothing gudin said tiredly as though he had heard every excuse imaginable i hit a sergeant sir and you gudin challenged lawford why did you run they were going to flog me sir lawford was nervous telling the lie and the nervousness intrigued gudin for doing nothing gudin asked with amusement for stealing a watch sir lawford reddened as he spoke which i did steal he added but most unconvincingly he had made no effort to hide the accent that betrayed his education though whether gudins ear was sufficiently attuned to english to detect the nuance was another matter the frenchman was certainly intrigued by lawford what did you say your name was the colonel asked lawford sir gudin gave lawford a long scrutiny the frenchman was tall and thin with a lugubrious and tired face but his eyes sharpe decided were shrewd and kind gudin sharpe reckoned was a gentleman a proper type of officer like lawford really and maybe that was the trouble maybe gudin had already seen through lawfords disguise you do not seem to me private lawford to be a typical british soldier gudin said thus fulfilling sharpes fears tn france now you would be nothing strange for we must insist that every young man serve his country but in britain am i not right you only accept the dregs of the streets men from the gutter men like me sharpe said quiet gudin reproved sharpe with a sudden authority i did not speak to you the frenchman took one of lawfords hands and mutely inspected the soft uncalloused fingers how is it that you are in the army lawford father went bankrupt sir lawford said conjuring the worst disaster that he could ever imagine but the son of a bankrupt father can take employment can he not gudin looked again at the soft fingers then released lawfords hand and any job surely is better than the life of a british soldier i got drunk sir lawford said miserably and i met a recruiting sergeant the lieutenants misery was not at the imagined memory but at the difficulty he was having in telling the lie but his demeanour impressed gudin it was in a pub sir in sheffield lawford went on the hawse in the lake sir in sheffield sir in pond lane sir on market day his voice tailed away as he suddenly realized he did not know which day of the week the market was held in sheffield gudin asked is that not where they make iron and what is the word cutlery you dont look like a cutler lawford i was a lawyers apprentice sir lawford was blushing violently he knew he had mixed up the name of the pub though it was doubtful that colonel gudin would ever know the difference but the lieutenant was certain his lies were as transparent as a pane of glass and your job in the army gudin asked company clerk sir gudin smiled no ink on your breeches lawford in our army the clerks spatter ink everywhere for a moment it seemed as though lawford was about to abandon his lie and in his misery confess the whole truth to the frenchman but then the lieutenant had a sudden inspiration i wear an apron sir when im writing i dont want to be punished for a dirty uniform sir gudin laughed in truth he had never doubted lawfords story mistaking the lieutenants embarrassment for shame at his familys bankruptcy if anything the frenchman felt sorry for the tall fairhaired and fastidious young man who should plainly never have become a soldier and that to gudin was enough to explain lawfords nervousness youre a clerk eh so does that mean you see paperwork a lot sir so do you know how many guns the british are bringing here gudin asked how much ammunition lawford shook his head in consternation for a few seconds he was speechless then managed to say that he never saw that sort of paperwork its just company papers i see sir punishment books that sort of thing bloody thousands sharpe interjected beg pardon for speaking sir thousands of what gudin asked bullocks sir six eighteenpounder shot strapped on apiece sir and some of the buggers have got eight but its thousands of round shot two thousand three gudin asked more than that sir i aint seen a herd the size of it not even when the scots drive the beeves down from scodand to london gudin shrugged he very much doubted whether these two could tell him anything useful certainly nothing that the tippoos scouts and spies had not already discovered but the questions had to be asked now waving flies from his face he told the two deserters what they might expect his majesty the tippoo sultan will decide your fate and if he is merciful he will want you to serve in his forces i assume you are willing yes sir sharpe said eagerly its why we came sir good gudin said the tippoo might want you in one of his own cushoons thats the word they use for a regiment here a cushoon theyre all good soldiers and well trained and youll be made welcome but there is one disadvantage you will both have to be circumcised lawford went pale while sharpe just shrugged is that bad sir you know what circumcision is private something the army does to you sir like swear you in gudin smiled not quite sharpe the tippoo is a muslim and he likes his foreign volunteers to join his religion it means one of his holy men will cut your foreskin off its quite quick just like slicing the top from a softboiled egg really my prick sharpe was as aghast as lawford now its over in seconds gudin reassured them though the bleeding can last for a while and you cannot how shall i say he glanced at mary then back to sharpe you cant let the egg become hard boiled for a few weeks bloody hell sir sharpe said for religion they do that we christians sprinkle babies with water gudin said and the muslims chop off foreskins the frenchman paused then smiled however i cannot think that a man with a bleeding prick will make a good soldier and your armies will be here in a few days so i will suggest to his majesty that the two of you serve with my men we are few but none of us are muslims and all of our softboiled eggs retain their full shells quite right too sir sharpe said enthusiastically and itll be an honour to serve you sir he added in a french battalion gudin teased him if you dont flog sir and you dont carve up pricks then itll be more than an honour if the tippoo allows it gudin warned them which he may not but i think he might i have other britishers in the battalion and some germans and swissim sure you will be happy there he looked at mary but what of you mademoiselle mary touched sharpes elbow i came with richard sir gudin inspected her black eye how did that happen mademoiselle i fell sir mary said gudins face flickered with a smile or did private sharpe hit you so that you would not appear attractive i fell over sir gudin nodded you hit hard private sharpe no point else sir that is true gudin said then shrugged my men have their women if his majesty allows it i dont see why the two of you should not stay together he turned as his sergeant reappeared bringing with him an elderly indian who carried a clothcovered basket this is doctor venkatesh gudin said greeting the doctor with a bow and he is quite as good as any physician i ever found in paris i imagine sharpe that removing those filthy bandages will hurt not as much as circumcising sir gudin laughed all the same i think you had better sit down removing the bandages hurt like buggery mister micklewhite the surgeon had put a salve on the lashes but no army surgeon ever wasted too much precious ointment on a common soldier and micklewhite had not used enough salve to stop the bandages from crusting to the wounds and so the cloth had become one clotted mass of linen and dried blood that tore the scabs away from the wounds as the indian peeled the bandages away doctor venkatesh was indeed skilful and gentle and his voice was ever soothing in sharpes ear as he delicately prised the horrid mess away from the torn flesh but even so sharpe could not forbear from whimpering as the bandages were lifted the tigers smelling fresh blood lunged at their chains so that the courtyard was filled with the clank and snap of stretching links the indian doctor plainly disapproved of both the injury and the treatment he tutted and muttered and shook his head as the carnage was revealed then when he had picked the last filthy scrap of bandage away with a pair of ivory tweezers he poured an unguent over sharpes back and the cool liquid was wonderfully soothing sharpe sighed with relief then suddenly the doctor sprang away from him stood clasped his hands and bowed low sharpe twisted round to see that a group of indians had come into the courtyard at their head was a shortish plump man maybe fifty years old with a round face and a neatly trimmed black moustache he was dressed in a white silk tunic above white silk leggings and black leather boots but the simple clothes glittered with jewels he wore rubies on his turban diamondstudded bangles on his arms and pearls were sewn onto his blue silk sash from which there hung a sapphirestudded scabbard in which rested a sword with a golden hilt fashioned into the face of a snarling tiger doctor venkatesh backed hurriedly away still bowing while gudin stood respectfully at attention the tippoo gudin warned sharpe and lawford in a whisper and sharpe struggled to his feet and like the frenchman stood to attention the tippoo stopped a halfdozen paces short of sharpe and lawford he stared at them for a few seconds then spoke softly to his interpreter turn round the interpreter ordered sharpe sharpe obediently turned showing his back to the tippoo who fascinated by the open wounds stepped close so he could inspect the damage sharpe could feel the tippoos breath on the back of his neck he could smell the mans subtle perfume and then he felt a spider soft touch as the tippoo fingered a strip of hanging skin then a sudden pain like the blow of a redhot poker slammed through sharpe he almost cried aloud but instead he stiffened and flinched the tippoo had thrust the tiger hilt of his sword against the deepest wound to see sharpes reaction he ordered sharpe to turn around and peered up to see whether there were any tears showing tears were pricking at sharpes eyes but none spilt onto his cheeks the tippoo nodded approval and stepped back so tell me about them he ordered gudin ordinary deserters gudin said in french to the interpreter that one he indicated sharpe is a tough soldier whod probably be a credit to any army the other ones just a clerk lawford tried not to show his disapproval of the judgement the tippoo glanced at him saw nothing to interest him and looked at mary instead the woman he asked gudin shes with the tall one gudin said again indicating sharpe then waited as the interpreter turned his answer into persian the tippoo gave mary a brief inspection she was slouching trying to accentuate her drab bruised and dirty appearance but when she saw his pensive gaze she became flustered and tried to make a curtsey the tippoo seemed amused by the gesture then looked back to gudin so what do they know of the british plans he asked gesturing at lawford and sharpe nothing they say they know nothing the tippoo corrected gudin and theyre not spies gudin shrugged how can one tell but i think not i think we can tell the tippoo said and i think we can discover what kind of soldiers they are too he turned and rapped some orders to an aide who bowed then ran out of the courtyard the aide returned with a pair of hunting muskets the longbarrelled weapons were like no guns sharpe had ever seen for their stocks were crusted with jewels and inlaid with a delicate ivory filigree the jewelled butts had an extravagant flair at their shoulder pieces and the two guns trigger guards were rimmed with small rubies the dogheads that held the flints had been fashioned into tiger heads with diamonds for the tigers eyes the tippoo took the guns made sure their flints were properly seated within the tiger jaws then tossed one gun to lawford and the other to sharpe the aide then placed a pot filled with black powder on the ground and beside it a pair of musket balls that sharpe could have sworn were made of silver load the guns the interpreter said a british soldier like any other learned to load with a paper cartridge but there was no mystery about using naked powder and ball plainly the tippoo wished to see how proficient the two men were and while lawford hesitated sharpe stooped to the pot and took out a handful of powder he straightened up and let the black powder trickle down the guns chased barrel the powder was extraordinarily fine and a fair bit blew away on the small wind but he had enough to spare and once the charge was safe inside the barrel he stooped again picked up the bullet shoved it into the muzzle and scraped the ramrod out of its three golden hoops he twirled the ramrod let it slide through his hand onto the bullet and then slammed the missile hard down onto the powder charge the tippoo had provided no wadding but sharpe guessed it did not matter he pulled the ramrod out reversed it and let it fall into the precious loops beneath the long barrel then he stooped again took a pinch of powder primed the gun closed the frizzen and stood to attention with the guns jewelled butt grounded beside him sir he said signifying he was done lawford was still trying to trickle powder into the muzzle the lieutenant was just as proficient at loading a gun as sharpe but being an officer he was never required to do it quickly for that was the one indispensable skill of a private soldier lawford only loaded guns while hunting but in the army he had a servant who loaded his pistols and never in his life had he needed to be quick with a gun and now he demonstrated a lamentable slowness he was a clerk sir sharpe explained to gudin he paused to lick the powder residue off his fingers he never needed to fight like the interpreter translated the words for the tippoo who waited patiently as lawford finished loading the musket the tippoo like his entourage was amused at the englishmans slowness but sharpes explanation that lawford had been a clerk seemed to convince them lawford at last finished and very selfconsciously stood to attention you can evidentiy load the tippoo said to sharpe but can you shoot aye sir sharpe answered the interpreter the tippoo pointed over sharpes shoulder then shoot him sharpe and lawford both turned to see an elderly british officer being escorted through the courtyards gate the man was weak and pale and he stumbled as the bright sunlight struck his eyes he cuffed with a manacled hand at his face then looked up and recognized lawford for a second an expression of disbelief crossed his face then he managed to hide whatever emotion he was feeling the officer was whitehaired and dressed in a kilt and red jacket both garments stained with dust and damp and sharpe horrified to see a british officer so dishevelled and humiliated presumed this had to be colonel mccandless you cant shoot lawford began shut up bill sharpe said and brought the musket up to his shoulder and swung its muzzle to face the horrified scots officer wait gudin shouted then spoke urgently to the tippoo the tippoo laughed away gudins protest instead he had his interpreter ask sharpe what he thought about british officers scum sir sharpe said loudly enough for colonel mccandless to hear goddamn bloody scum sir think theyre better than us because the bastards can read and were born with a bit of money but there aint one i couldnt beat in a fight you are willing to shoot that one the interpreter asked td pay for the chance sharpe said vengefully lawford hissed at him but sharpe ignored the warning pay for it he said again his majesty would like you to do it very close the interpreter said he wants you to blow the mans head off itll be a bloody pleasure sharpe said enthusiastically he cocked the gun as he walked towards the man he presumed he had been sent to save he stared at mccandless as he approached and there was nothing but brute pleasure on sharpes hard face stuckup scotch bastard sharpe spat at him he looked at the two guards who still flanked the colonel move out the way you stupid sods else youll be smothered in the bastards blood the two men stared blankly at him but neither moved and sharpe guessed that neither man spoke any english doctor venkatesh who had been trying to hide in the gateways shadows shook his head in horror at what was about to happen sharpe raised the musket so that its muzzle was no more than six inches from mccandlesss face any message for general harris he asked softly mccandless again hid his reaction other than sparing one glance at lawford then he looked back to sharpe and spat at him attack anywhere but from the west the scotsman said quietly and then much louder may god forgive you bugger god sharpe said then pulled the trigger the flint fell it snapped its spark on the frizzen and nothing else happened mccandlesss face jerked back as the flint sparked then an expression of pure relief crossed his face sharpe hesitated a second then drove the guns muzzle into the colonels belly the blow looked hard but he checked it at the last moment mccandless still doubled over gasping and sharpe raised the jewelled butt to bring it hard down on the officers grey head stop gudin shouted sharpe paused and turned i thought you wanted the bugger dead the tippoo laughed we need him alive for a while but you passed your test he turned and spoke to gudin and gudin answered vigorously it seemed to sharpe mat they were discussing his fate and he prayed he would be spared a painful initiation into one of the tippoos cushoons another indian officer a tall man in a silk tunic decorated with the tippoos tiger stripes was talking to mary while sharpe still stood above the crouching mccandless did harris send you mccandless asked softly yes sharpe hissed not looking at the colonel mary was shaking her head she glanced at sharpe then looked back to the tall indian beware the west mccandless whispered nothing else the scotsman groaned pretending to be in much more pain than he was he retched dryly tried to stand and instead toppled over youre a traitor he said loudly enough for gudin to hear him and youll die a traitors death sharpe spat on mccandless come here sharpe gudin disapproval plain in his voice ordered him sharpe marched back to lawfords side where one of the tippoos attendants took back the two muskets the tippoo gestured at mccandlesss guards evidently signifying that the scotsman was to be returned to his cell the tippoo then gave sharpe an approving nod before turning and leading his entourage out of the courtyard the tall indian in the silk tiger stripes beckoned to mary tm to go with him love she explained to sharpe i thought you were staying with me sharpe protested im to earn my keep she said im to teach his little sons english and sweep and wash of course she added bitterly colonel gudin intervened she will join you later he told sharpe but for now you are both how do you say it on test probation sir lawford offered exactly gudin said and soldiers on probation are not permitted wives dont worry sharpe im sure your woman will be safe in general raos house now go mademoiselle mary stood on tiptoe and kissed sharpes cheek ill be all right love she whispered and so will you look after yourself lass sharpe said and watched her follow the tall indian officer out of the courtyard gudin gestured towards the archway we must let doctor venkatesh finish your back sharpe then give you both new uniforms and muskets welcome to the tippoo sultans army gentlemen you earn a haideri each every day good money sharpe said impressed a haideri was worth half a crown far above the miserable tuppence a day he received in the british army but doubtless in arrears lawford said sarcastically he was still angry at sharpe for having tried to shoot mccandless and the muskets misfire had not placated him the pay is always in arrears gudin admitted cheerfully but in what army is the pay ever on time officially you earn a haideri a day though you will rarely receive it but i can promise you other consolations now come he summoned doctor venkatesh who retrieved his basket and followed gudin out of the palace thus sharpe went to meet his new comrades and readied himself to face a new enemy his own side general david baird did not feel guilty about sharpe and lawford for they were soldiers and were paid to take risks but he did feel responsible for them the fact that neither the british nor indian cavalry patrols had discovered the two men suggested that they might well have reached seringapatam but the more baird thought about their mission the less sanguine he was about its successful completion it had seemed a good idea when he had first thought of it but two days reflection had diluted that initial hope with a score of reservations he had always suspected that even with the help of ravi shekhar their chances of rescuing mccandless were woefully small but at the very least he had hoped they might learn mccandlesss news and succeed in bringing it out of the city but now he feared that neither man would even survive at best he thought the two men could only hope to escape execution by joining the tippoos forces which would mean that both sharpe and lawford would be in enemy uniform when the british assaulted the city there was litde baird could do about that but he could prevent a dreadful miscarriage of justice following the citys fall and so that night when the two armies great encampment was established just a few days march from their goal baird sought out the lines of the rd major shee seemed alarmed at the generals sudden appearance but baird soothed the major and explained he had a little business with the light company nothing to trouble you major just an administrative matter a triviality iil take you to captain morris sir shee said then clapped on his hat and led the general down the line of officers tents its the end one sir he said nervously do you need me at all i wouldnt waste your time shee on trifles but im obliged for your help though baird found a shirtsleeved captain morris frowning at his paperwork in the company of an oddly malevolentlooking sergeant who at the generals unannounced arrival sprang to quivering attention morris hastily placed his cocked hat over a tin mug that baird suspected was full of arrack captain morris the general asked sir morris upset his chair as he stood up then he plucked his red coat off the floor where it had fallen with the chair baird waved to show that morris need not worry about donning a coat theres no need for formality captain leave your coat off man leave it off its desperately hot isnt it unbearable sir morris said nervously im baird baird introduced himself i dont think weve had the pleasure no sir morris was too nervous to introduce himself properly sit you down man baird said trying to put the captain at his ease sit you down may i baird gestured at morriss cot asking permission to use it as a chair thank you kindly baird said then he sat took off his plumed hat and fanned his face with its brim i think ive forgotten what cold weather is like do you think it still snows anywhere my god but it saps a man this heat saps him do relax sergeant thank you sir sergeant hakeswills stiff posture unbent a fraction baird smiled at morris you lost two men this week captain did you not two men morris frowned that bastard sharpe had run taking his bibbi with him but who else oh morris said you mean lieutenant lawford sir the very fellow a lucky fellow too eh carrying the despatch to madras its quite an honour for him baird shook his head ruefully myself im not so certain that little scrap the other day was worth a despatch but general harris insisted and your colonel chose lawford baird was using the excuse the army had invented to explain lawfords disappearance the excuse had provoked some resentment in the rd for lawford was one of the most junior of the battalions lieutenants and most men who carried despatches could expect a promotion as a reward for the task which in turn was usually only given to men who had distinguished themselves in battle it seemed to morris as to every other officer in the battalion that lawford had neither distinguished himself nor deserved promotion but morris could hardly admit as much to baird very glad for him morris managed to say found a replacement have you baird asked ensign fitzgerald sir morris said lieutenant fitzgerald now sir by brevet of course morris managed to sound disapproving he would have much preferred ensign hicks to have received the temporary promotion but hicks did not have the hundred and fifty pounds needed to purchase up from ensign to lieutenant whereas fitzgerald did and if lawfords reward for carrying the despatches was a promotion to captain then fitzgerald must replace him in morriss opinion the newly breveted lieutenant was altogether too easy with the men but a money draft was a money draft and fitzgerald was the monied candidate and so had been given the temporary rank and the other fellow you lost baird asked trying hard to sound casual the private in the book is he hes in the book all right sir the sergeant answered for morris hakeswill sir he introduced himself sergeant obadiah hakeswill sir man and boy in the army sir and at your command sir what was the rogues name baird asked morris sharpe sir hakeswill again answered richard sharpe sir and as filthy horrible a little piece of work as ever i did see sir in all my born days sir the book baird asked morris ignoring hakeswills judgement morris frantically searched the mess on his desk for the punishment book at the back of which were kept the armys official forms for deserters hakeswill eventually found it and with a crisp gesture handed it to the general sir baird leafed through the front pages finally discovering the entry for sharpes court martial two thousand strokes the scotsman said in horror it must have been a grave offence struck a sergeant sir hakeswill announced you perhaps baird asked drily noting the sergeants swollen and bruised nose without any provocation sir hakeswill said earnestly as god is my judge sir i never treated young dick sharpe with anything but kindness like one of my own children he was sir if i had any children which i dont at least not so as i knows of he was a very lucky man sir to be let off at two hundred lashes and you see how he rewards us hakeswill sniffed indignantly baird did not respond but just turned to the last page of the book where he found the name richard sharpe filled in at the top of the printed form and beneath it sharpes age which was given as twentytwo years and six months though captain morris if indeed it had been morris who had filled in the form had placed a question mark beside the age sharpes height was reported at six feet only four inches less than baird himself who was one of the tallest men in the army make or form was the next question to which morris had answered well built and there followed a list of headings head face eyes eyebrows nose mouth neck hair shoulders arms hands thighs legs and feet morris had filled them all in thus offering a comprehensive description of the missing man where born was answered simply by london while besides former trade or occupation was written thief the form then gave the date and place of desertion and offered a description of the clothes the deserter had been wearing when last seen the final item on the form was general remarks beside which morris had written back scarred from flogging a dangerous man baird shook his head a formidable description captain the general said thank you sir its been distributed tomorrow sir morris blushed the form should have been copied out four times one copy went to the general commanding the army who would have it copied again and distributed to every unit under his command a second copy would go to madras in case sharpe ran there a third copy went to the war office in london to be copied again and given to all recruiting officers in case the man succeeded in reaching britain and tried to rejoin the army while the last copy was supposedly sent to the mans home parish to alert his neighbours to his treachery and the local constables to his crime in sharpes case there was no home parish but once morris caught up with his paperwork and the company clerk had made the necessary copies sharpes description would be broadcast throughout the army if sharpe was then found in seringapatam which baird suspected he would be he was supposed to be arrested but it was far more likely that he would be killed most soldiers resented deserters not because of their crime but because they had dared to do what so many others never had the courage to try and no officer would punish a man for killing a deserter baird put the open book onto morriss table i want you to add a note under general remarks baird told the captain of course sir just say that it is vital that private sharpe be taken alive and that if he is captured he must be brought either to me or to general harris morris gaped at baird you sir baird baird major general yes sir but morris had been about to ask what possible business a major general had with a deserter then realized that such a question would never fetch a civil answer so he just dipped a quill in ink and hurriedly added the words baird had requested you think we might see sharpe again sir he asked i do hope so captain baird stood i even pray as much now may i thank you for your hospitality yes sir of course sir morris half stood as the general left then dropped back onto his chair and stared at the words he had just written what in gods name is all that about he asked when baird was safely out of earshot hakeswill sniffed no good sir ill warrant that morris uncovered the arrack and took a sip first the bastard is summoned to harriss tent then he runs and now baird says well see him again and wants him kept alive why hes up to no good sir hakeswill said he took his woman and vanished sir aint no general who can condone that behaviour sir its unforgivable sir the armys going to the dogs sir i cant disobey baird morris muttered but you dont wants sharpie back here either sir hakeswill said fervently a soldier whos a generals pet hell be given a sergeants stripes next the thought of such an affront struck hakeswill momentarily speechless his face quivered with indignation then with a visible effort he controlled himself who knows sir he suggested slyly but the little bastard might be reporting on you and me sir like the traitor what he is we dont need snakes in our bosoms sir we dont want to disturb the happy mood of the company not by harbouring a generals pet sir generals pet morris repeated softly the captain was a venal man and though no worse than many he nevertheless dreaded official scrutiny but he was far too lazy to correct the malfeasances half concealed in the closely penned columns of the pay books worse morris feared that sharpe could somehow reveal his complicity in the false charge that had resulted in sharpes flogging and though it seemed impossible for a mere private to carry that much weight in the army so it seemed equally impossible that a major general should make a special errand to discuss that private there was something very odd going on and morris disliked strange threats he merely asked for the quiet life and he wanted sharpe out of it but i cant leave those words off the form he complained to hakeswill gesturing at the new addition on sharpes page dont need to sir with respect sir aint no form being distributed here sir not in the rd sir dont need a form do we we knows what the bugger looks like we does so they wont give us no form sir they never do sir so ill let it be known that if anyone sees sharpie theyre to oblige the army by putting a goolie in his back hakeswill saw morriss nervousness wont be no fuss sir not if the buggers in seringapatam and were pulling the bloody place to pieces kill him quick sir and thats more than he deserves hes up to no good sir i can feel it in my waters and a bugger up to no good is a bugger better off dead says so in the scriptures sir im sure it does sergeant im sure it does morris said then closed the punishment book you must do whatever you think is best sergeant i know i can trust you you do me honour sir hakeswill said with feigned emotion you do me honour and ill have the bastard for you sir have him proper dead in seringapatam what in gods name did you think you were doing sharpe lawford demanded furiously the lieutenant was much too angry to go along with the pretence of being a private and besides the two men were now alone for the first time that day alone but not unguarded for though they were standing sentry in one of the south wall cavaliers there were a dozen men of gudins battalion within sight including the burly sergeant called rothiere who watched the two newcomers from the next cavalier along by god private lawford hissed iil have you flogged for that display when were back were here to rescue colonel mccandless not to kill him are you mad sharpe stared south across the landscape saying nothing to his right the shallow river flowed between shelving green banks once the monsoon came the river would swell and spread and drown the wide flat rocks that dotted its bed he was feeling more comfortable now for doctor venkatesh had placed some salve on his back which had taken away a lot of the pain the doctor had then put on new bandages and warned sharpe that they must not be dampened but ought to be changed each day until the wounds healed colonel gudin had then taken the two englishmen to a barracks room close by the citys southwestern corner every man in the barracks was a european most of them french but with a scattering of swiss germans and two britishers they all wore the blue coats of french infantry but there were none to spare for the two new men and so sergeant rothiere had issued sharpe and lawford with tiger tunics like those the tippoos men wore the tunics did not open down the front like a european coat but had to be pulled over the head where you boys from an english voice asked sharpe as he pulled down the dyed cotton tunic rd sharpe had said the havercakes the man said thought they were up north in calcutta brought down to madras last year sharpe said he gingerly sat on his cot an indian bed made from ropes stretched between a simple wooden frame it proved surprisingly comfortable and you he asked the englishman royal bleeding artillery mate both of us ran three months back names johnny blake and thats henry hickson tm dick sharpe and thats bill lawford sharpe said introducing the lieutenant who looked desperately awkward in his kneelength tunic of purple and white stripes over the tunic he wore two crossbelts and an ordinary belt from which hung a bayonet and a cartridge pouch they had been issued with heavy french muskets and warned they would have to do their share of sentry duty with the rest of the small battalion used to be a lot more of us blake told sharpe but men die here like flies fever mostly but it aint bad here henry hickson offered foods all right plenty of bibbis and gudins a real decent officer better than any we ever had right bastards we had blake agreed arent they all sharpe had said and the pays good when you get it five months overdue now but maybe well get it when we beat the stuffing out of the british blake laughed at the suggestion blake and hickson were not required to stand guard but instead manned one of the big tigermouthed guns that crouched behind a nearby embrasure sharpe and lawford stood their watch alone and it was that privacy which had encouraged lawford into his furious attack have you got nothing to say for yourself private he challenged sharpe who still stared serenely over the green landscape through which the river curled south about the citys island well lawford snapped sharpe looked at him you loaded the musket didnt you bill of course you ever felt gunpowder that smooth and fine sharpe gazed into the lieutenants face it could have been gunpowder dust lawford insisted angrily that shiny sharpe said derisively gunpowder dust is full of rat shit and sawdust and did you really think bill he pronounced the name sarcastically that the bleeding tippoo would let us have loaded guns before he was sure he could trust us and with him standing not six feet away and did you bother to taste the powder i did and it werent salty at all that werent gunpowder lieutenant that were either ink powder or black pigment but whatever it was it was never going to spark lawford gaped at sharpe so you knew all along the gun wouldnt fire of course i bloody knew i wouldnt have pulled the trigger else you mean you didnt realize that werent powder lawford turned away once again he had been made to look like a fool and he blushed at the realization im sorry he said he was crestfallen and again he felt a galling sense of inadequacy compared to this common soldier sharpe stared at a patrol of the tippoos lancers who were riding back towards the city three of them were wounded and were being supported in their saddles by their comrades which suggested the british were not so very far away now tm sorry sir he said very softly and deliberately using the word sir to mollify lawford but im not trying to be insolent im just trying to keep you and me alive i know im sorry too i should have known it wasnt powder it was confusing werent it sharpe said trying to console his companion what with the tippoo being there fat little bugger aint he but youre doing all right sir sharpe spoke feelingly knowing that the young lieutenant desperately needed encouragement and you were clever as hell sir saying you wore an apron i should have splashed some ink on your uniform shouldnt i but i never thought of it but you got us out of that one i was thinking of private brookfield lawford said not without some pride at the memory of his inspired lie you know brookfield the clerk of mister stanbridges company sir fellow who wears spectacles does he wear a pinny he says it keeps the ink off him he always was an old woman sharpe said scornfully but you did well and ill tell you something else we have to get out of here soon because i know why we came now we dont have to find your merchant fellow we just have to get out unless you think we ought to rescue your uncle but if you dont then we can just run because i know why we came now lawford gaped at him you know the colonel spoke to me sir while we was going through that pantomime back there in the palace he says were to tell general harris to avoid the west wall nothing else just that lawford stared at sharpe then glanced across the angle of the city walls towards the western defences but nothing he could see there looked strange or suspicious youd better stop calling me sir he said are you sure about what he said he said it twice avoid the west wall a bellow from the next cavalier made them turn rothiere was pointing south suggesting that the two englishmen watch that direction as they were supposed to instead of gaping like yokels towards the west sharpe obediently stared southwards though there was nothing to be seen there except some women carrying loads on their heads and a thin naked boy herding some scrawny came along the river bank his duty now sharpe thought was to escape this place and get back to the british army but how in gods name was he ever to do that if he were to jump off the wall now sharpe reckoned he would stand a halfchance of breaking a leg and even if he survived the jump he would only land in the glacis ditch and if he managed to cross the glacis he would merely reach the military encampment that was built hard around the citys southern and eastern walls and if he was lucky enough to escape the hundreds of soldiers who would converge on him he would still need to cross the river and meanwhile every gun on the encampment wall would be hammering at his heels and once he had crossed the river if he ever did the tippoos lancers would be waiting on the far bank the sheer impossibility of escaping the city made him smile god knows how we ever get out of here he said to lawford maybe at night lawford suggested vaguely if they ever let us stand guard at night sharpe said dubiously then thought of mary could he leave her in the city so what do we do lawford asked what we always do in the army sharpe said stoically hurry up and do nothing wait for the opportunity itll come itll come and in the meantime maybe we can find out just what the devils are doing in the west of the city eh lawford shuddered im glad i brought you sharpe you are sharpe grinned at that compliment ill tell you when ill be glad when you take me back home to the army and suddenly after weeks of thinking about desertion sharpe realized that what he had just said was true he did want to go back to the army and that knowledge surprised him the army had bored richard sharpe then done its best to break his spirits it had even flogged him but now standing on seringapatams battlements he missed the army for at heart as richard sharpe had just discovered for himself he was a soldier chapter the armies of britain and hyderabad reached seringapatam four days later the first evidence of their coming was a cloud of dust that thickened and rose to obscure the eastern horizon a great fog of dust kicked up by thousands of hooves boots and wheels the two armies had crossed the river well to the citys east and were now on its southern bank and sharpe climbed with the rest of gudins men to the firestep above the mysore gate to watch the first british cavalry patrols appear in the distance a torrent of lancers clattered out of the gate to challenge the invaders the tippoos men rode with green and scarlet pennants on their lance heads and beneath silk banners showing the golden sun blazoned against a scarlet field once the lancers had passed through the gate a succession of painted ox carts squealed and ground their way into the city each loaded with rice grain or beans there was plenty of water inside seringapatam for not only did the river cauvery wash beneath two of the walls but each street had its own well and now the tippoo was making certain that the granaries were filled to overflowing the citys magazines were already crammed with ammunition there were guns in every embrasure and behind the walls spare guns waited to replace any that were dismounted sharpe had never seen so many guns the tippoo sultan had great faith in artillery and he had collected cannon of every shape and size there were guns with barrels disguised as crouching tigers and guns inscribed with flowing arabic letters and guns supplied from france some still with the ancient bourbon cipher incised close to their touchholes there were huge guns with barrels over twenty feet long that fired stone balls close to fifty pounds in weight and small guns scarce longer than a musket that fired individual balls of grape the tippoo intended to meet any british assault with a storm of cannon fire and not just cannon fire for as the two enemy armies marched closer to the city the rocketmen brought their strange weapons to the firesteps sharpe had never seen rockets before and he gaped as the missiles were stacked against the parapets each was an iron tube some four or five inches wide and about eighteen inches long that was attached by leather thongs to a bamboo stick that stood higher than a man a crude tin cone tipped the iron cylinder and inside the cone was either a small solid shot or else an explosive charge that was ignited by the rockets own gunpowder propellant the missiles were fired by lighting a twist of paper that emerged from the base of the iron cylinders some of the rocket tubes had been wrapped with paper then painted with either snarling tigers or verses from the koran theres a man in ireland working on a similar weapon lawford told sharpe though i dont think he puts tigers on his rocket heads how do you aim the bloody things sharpe asked some of the rockets had been placed ready to fire but there was no gun barrel to direct them instead they were simply laid on the parapet and pointed in the general direction of the enemy you dont really aim them lawford said at least i dont think you do theyre just pointed in the right direction and fired they are notoriously inaccurate he added at least i hope they are well see soon enough sharpe said as another handcart of the strange missiles was heaved up the ramp to the firestep sharpe looked forward to seeing the rockets fired but then it became apparent that the british and hyderabad armies were not approaching the city directly and thus bringing themselves into range but instead planned to march clear around seringapatams southern margin the progress of the two armies was painfully slow they had appeared at dawn but by nightfall they had still not completed their halfcircuit of the island on which seringapatam sat a crowd of spectators thronged the city ramparts to watch the enormous sprawl of herds battalions cavalry squadrons guns civilians and wagons that filled the southern landscape dust surrounded the armies like an english fog from time to time the fog thickened as a group of the tippoos lancers attacked some vulnerable spot but each time the lancers were met by a countercharge of allied cavalry and more dust would spew up from the horses hooves as the riders charged clashed circled and fought one lancer rode back to the city with a british cavalrymans hat held aloft on his spear point and the soldiers on the walls cheered his return but gradually the greater number of allied cavalry gained the upper hand and the cheers died away as more and more of the tippoos horsemen splashed back wounded through the south cauverys ford some of the enemy when the tippoos cavalry was driven away ventured closer to the city small groups of officers trotted their horses towards the river so that they could examine the city walls and it was one such group that drew the first rocket fire sharpe watched fascinated as an officer turned one of the long weapons on the flat top of the parapet so that its tin cone pointed directly towards the nearest group of horsemen the rocketman waited beside his officer swinging a length of slow match to keep its burning end bright and hot the officer fussed with the rockets alignment then satisfied at last he stepped back and nodded to the rocketman who grinned and touched his slow match to the twist of paper at the rockets base the fuse paper sharpe guessed had been soaked in water diluted with gunpowder then dried because it immediately caught the glowing fire which ate its way swiftly up the fuse as the rocketman stepped hurriedly away the glowing trail vanished into the iron cylinder there was silence for a second then the rocket twitched as a bright flame abruptly choked and spat from the tubes base the twitch of the igniting powder charge threw the heavy rocket out of its careful alignment but there was no chance to correct the weapons aim for a jet of flame was spitting fiercely enough from the cylinder to scorch the rockets quivering bamboo stick and then very suddenly the bright flame roared into a furnacelike intensity with a noise like a huge waterfall only instead of water it was spewing sparks and smoke as the rocket began to move it trembled for an instant scraped an inch or two across the parapet then abruptly accelerated away into the air leaving a thick cloud of smoke and a scorch mark on the parapets coping for a few seconds it seemed as if the rocket was having trouble staying aloft for the long scorched tail wobbled as the fiery tube fought against gravity and as the smoke trail stitched a crazy whorl above the ditch at the foot of the wall but then at last it gained momentum and raced away across the glacis the encampment and the river it spewed a tail of sparks fire and smoke as it flew then as the powder charge began to be exhausted the rocket fell earthwards beneath the missile the group of horsemen had collapsed their spyglasses and were fleeing in every direction as the firetailed demon came shrieking out of the sky the rocket struck the ground bounced tumbled then exploded with a small crack of noise and a burst of flame and white smoke none of the horsemen had been touched but their panic delighted the tippoos men on the bastions who gave the rocketmen a cheer sharpe cheered with them farther up the wall a cannon fired at a second group of horsemen the smoke of the gun billowed out across the encampment beneath the walls and the heavy round shot screamed across the river to disembowel a horse a halfmile away but no one cheered the gunners guns were not so spectacular as rockets hes got thousands of those bloody things sharpe told lawford indicating a pile of the rockets they really arent very accurate lawford said with pedantic disapproval but fire enough at once and you wouldnt know if you were in this world or the next i wouldnt fancy being on the wrong end of a dozen of those things behind them from one of the tall white minarets of the citys new mosque the muezzin was chanting the summons for the evening prayer and the muslim rocketmen hastened to unroll their small prayer mats and face westwards towards mecca sharpe and lawford also faced west not out of any respect for the tippoos religion but because the vanguard of british and indian cavalry was scouting the flat land beyond the south gauvery which was plainly visible from the summit of the mysore gate the main body of the two armies was making camp well to the south of the city but the horsemen had ridden ahead to reconnoitre the western country in preparation for the next days short march sharpe could even see officers pacing out and marking where the lascars would pitch the armies tents it seemed that general harris had decided to attack from the west the one direction that mccandless had warned against poor bloody fools sharpe said though neither he nor lawford yet knew what was dangerous about the western defences nor had they been given the slightest chance to escape from the city they were never unwatched they were never allowed to stand guard at night and sharpe knew that even the smallest attempt to break away from the city would lead to immediate death yet they were not otherwise treated badly they had been accepted well enough by their new comrades but sharpe could detect a reserve and he supposed that until he and lawford proved their reliability there would always be an undercurrent of suspicion it aint that they dont trust you henry hickson had explained on their first night but till theyve actually seen you bang a few bails off at your old mates they wont really know whether youre stout hickson was sewing up the frayed edge of his leather thumbstall which protected his hand when a cannon was swabbed out the gunner had to stop the touchhole so that the rammer could not drive a jet of fresh air down the barrel and so ignite any scraps of remaining powder and hicksons old and blackened thumbstall betrayed how long he had been an artilleryman had this in america hickson said flourishing the ancient scrap of leather stitched for me by a little girl in charleston lovely little thing she was how long have you been in the artillery lawford had asked the greyhaired hickson bleeding lifetime bill joined in hickson laughed king and country go and save the colonies eh and all i did was march up and down like a little lost lamb and only ever fired a dozen shots i should have stayed there shouldnt i when they kicked us out but like a fool i didnt went to gibraltar polished cannon for a couple of years then got posted out here so why did you run lawford asked money of course the tippoo might be a black heathen bastard but he pays well for gunners when he pays at all of course which isnt precisely frequent but all the same he aint done bad by me and if id stayed in the gunners i wouldnt have met suni would i he had jerked his calloused thumb towards his indian woman who was cooking the evening meal with the wives of the other soldiers dont you ever worry that youll be recaptured lawford asked him of course i bloody worry all the bleeding time hickson held the thumbstall close to his right eye to judge the neatness of his stitching christ bill i dont want to be stood up against a bleeding post with a dozen bastards staring down their musket barrels at me i want to die in sunis bed he grinned you do ask the most stupid questions bill but what do you expect of a bleeding clerk all that reading and writing mate it doesnt do a man any bleeding good he had shaken his head in despair of lawford ever seeing sense like all of gudins soldiers hickson was more suspicious of lawford than of sharpe they all understood sharpe for he was one of them and good at his trade but lawford was patently uncomfortable they put it down to his having come from a comfortable home that had fallen on hard times and while they were sympathetic to that misfortune they nevertheless expected him to make the best of it others in gudins small battalion despised lawford for his clumsiness with weapons but sharpe was his friend and so far no man had been willing to risk sharpes displeasure by needling lawford sharpe and lawford watched the invading armies make their camp well out of cannon range to the south of the city a few mysorean cavalrymen still circled the armies watching for a chance to snap up a fugitive but most of the tippoos men were now back on the citys island there was an excited buzz in the city almost a relief that the enemy was in sight and the waiting at last was over there was also a feeling of confidence for although the enemy horde looked vast the tippoo had formidable defences and plenty of men sharpe could detect no lack of enthusiasm among the hindu troops lawford had told him there was bad blood between them and the muslims but on that evening as the tippoos men hung more defiant banners above their limewashed walls the city seemed united in its defiance sergeant rothiere shouted at sharpe and lawford from the inner wall of the mysore gate pointing to the big bastion at the citys southwestern corner colonel gudin wants us lawford translated for sharpe vitel rothiere bellowed now lawford said nervously the two men threaded their way through the spectators who crowded the parapets until they found colonel gudin in a cavalier that jutted south from the huge square bastion hows your back the frenchman greeted sharpe mending wonderfully sir gudin smiled pleased at the news its indian medicine sharpe if i ever go back to france ive a mind to take a native doctor with me much better than ours all a french doctor would do is bleed you dry then console your widow the colonel turned and gestured south across the river your old friends he said indicating where the british and indian cavalry were exploring the land between the armys encampment and the city most were staying well out of range of seringapatams cannon but a few braver souls were galloping closer to the city either to tempt the tippoos cavalry to come out and dare single combat or else to provoke the gunners on the city wall one especially flamboyant group was shouting towards the city and even waving as though inviting cannon fire and every now and then a cannon would boom or a rocket scream across the river though somehow the jeering cavalrymen always remained untouched theyre distracting us gudin explained drawing attention away from some others there see some bushes beside the cistern he was pointing across the river there are some scouts there on foot they are trying to see what defences we have close to the river you see them look in the bushes under the two palm trees sharpe stared but could see nothing you want us to go and get them sir he offered i want you to shoot them gudin said the bushes under the twin palms were nearly quarter of a mile away long bloody range for a musket sir sharpe said dubiously try this then gudin said and held out a gun it must have been one of the tippoos own weapons for its stock was decorated with ivory its tigerhead lock was chased with gold and its barrel engraved with arabic writing sharpe took and hefted the gun might be pretty sir he said but no amount of fancy work on the outside will make it more accurate than that plain old thing he patted his heavy french musket youre wrong gudin said thats a rifle a rifle sharpe had heard of such weapons but he had never handled one and now he peered inside the muzzle and saw that the barrel was indeed cut in a pattern of spiralling grooves he had heard that the grooves spun the bullet which somehow made a rifle far more accurate than a shot from a smoothbore musket why that should be the case he had not the slightest idea but every man he had ever spoken to about rifles had sworn it was true still he said dubiously near a quartermile long ways for a bullet sir even if it is spinning that rifle can kill at four hundred paces sharpe gudin said confidently its loaded by the way the colonel added and sharpe who had been peering down the muzzle again jerked back gudin laughed loaded with the best powder and with its bullet wrapped in oiled leather i want to see how good a shot you are no you dont sir sharpe said you want to see if im willing to kill my own countrymen that too of course gudin agreed placidly and laughed at having had his small ploy discovered at that range you should aim about six or seven feet above your target i have another rifle for you lawford but i dont suppose we can expect a clerk to be as accurate as a skirmisher like sharpe iil do my best sir lawford said and took the second rifle from gudin lawford might be clumsy at loading a gun but he was a practised shot in the hunting field and had been firing rifled fowling pieces since he was eight years old some men find it hard to shoot at their old comrades gudin told lawford mildly and i want to make sure youre not among them lets hope the bastards are officers sharpe said begging your presence sir there they are gudin said and sure enough just beside the cistern beneath the two palm trees across the river were a pair of red coats the men were examining the city walls through telescopes their horses were picketed behind them sharpe knelt in a gun embrasure he instinctively felt that the range was much too long for any firearm but he had heard about the miracle of rifles and he was curious to see if the rumours were true you take the one on the left bill he said and fire just after me he glanced at gudin and saw that the colonel had moved a few feet down the cavalier to watch the effect of the shots from a place where the rifles smoke would not obscure his glass and aim well bill sharpe said in a low voice theyre probably only bloody cavalrymen so who cares if we plug them with a pair of bloody goolies he crouched behind the rifle and aligned its welldefined sights that were so much more impressive than the rudimentary stub that served a musket as a foresight a man could stand fifty feet in front of a wellaimed musket and still stand a better than evens chance of walking away unscathed but the delicacy of the rifles sights seemed to confirm what everyone had told sharpe this was a longrange killer he settled himself firmly keeping the sights lined on the distant man then gently raised the barrel so that the rifles muzzle obscured his target but would give the ball the needed trajectory there was no wind to speak of so he had no need to offset his aim he had never fired a rifle but it was just common sense really nor was he unduly worried about killing one of his own side it was a sad necessity something that needed to be done if he was to earn gudins trust and thus the freedom that might let him escape from the city he took a breath half let it out then pulled the trigger the gun banged into his shoulder its recoil much harder than an ordinary muskets blow lawford fired a halfsecond later the smoke of his gun joining the dense cloud pumped out by sharpes rifle the clerk wins gudin exclaimed in astonishment he lowered his spyglass yours went six inches past the mans head sharpe but i think you killed your man lawford well done well done indeed lawford reddened but said nothing he looked very troubled and gudin put his evident confusion down to a natural shyness is that the first man youve ever killed he asked gently yes sir lawford said truthfully enough you deserve to be better than a clerk well done well done both of you he took the rifles from them and laughed at sharpes rueful expression you expected to do better sharpe yes sir you will six inches off at that distance is very good shooting very good indeed gudin turned to watch as the uninjured redcoat dragged his companion back towards the horses i think maybe gudin went on that you have a natural talent lawford i congratulate you the colonel fished in his pouch and brought out a handful of coins an advance on your arrears of pay well done off you go now sharpe glanced behind him hoping to see what devilment the western walls held but he could see nothing strange there and so he turned and followed lawford down the ramp lawford was shaking i didnt mean to kill him the lieutenant said when he was out of gudins earshot i did sharpe muttered god what have i done i was aiming left dont be a bloody fool sharpe said what youve done is earned our freedom you did bloody well he dragged lawford into a tavern the tippoo might be a muslim and the muslims might preach an extraordinary hatred of alcohol but most of the city was hindu and the tippoo was sensible enough to keep the taverns open this one close to gudins barracks was a big room open to the street with a dozen tables where old men played chess and young men boasted of the slaughter they would inflict on the besiegers the tavernkeeper a big woman with hard eyes sold a variety of strange drinks wine and arrack mostly but she also kept a weirdtasting beer sharpe could still hardly speak a word of the local language but he pointed to the arrack barrel and held up two fingers now that he and lawford were dressed in the tigerstriped tunics and carried muskets they attracted little attention in the city and no hostility here he put the arrack in front of lawford drink that lawford drank it in one go that was the first man ive killed he said blinking from the harshness of the liquor worry you of course it does he was british cant skin a cat without making a bloody mess sharpe said comfortingly jesus lawford said angrily sharpe poured half his liquor into lawfords glass then beckoned to one of the serving girls who circled the tables refilling glasses you had to do it he said if id have missed like you lawford said ruefully gudin would have been just as impressed that was a fine shot of yours i was aiming to kill the bugger you were lawford was shocked jesus christ bill we have to convince these buggers sharpe smiled as the girl poured more liquor then he tipped a handful of small brass coins into a wooden bowl on the table another bowl held a strange spice which the other drinkers nibbled between sips but sharpe found the stuff too pungent once the girl was gone he looked at the troubled lieutenant did you think this was going to be easy lawford was silent for a few seconds then gave a shrug in truth i thought it would be impossible so why did you come lawford cradled the glass in both hands and stared at sharpe as if weighing up whether or not to answer to get away from morris he finally confessed and for the excitement he seemed embarrassed to admit as much morris is a bastard sharpe said feelingly lawford frowned at the criticism hes bored he said chidingly then he steered the conversation away from the danger area of criticizing a superior officer and i also came because i owe gratitude to my uncle and because it would get you noticed lawford looked up with some surprise on his face then he nodded that too same as me then sharpe said exact same as me except till the general said you was coming with me i had half a mind to run proper lawford was shocked by the admission you really wanted to desert for christs sake what do you think its like in the ranks if youve got an officer like morris and a sergeant like hakeswill those bastards think were just bleeding cattle but were not most of us want to do a decent job not too decent maybe we want a bit of money and a bibbi from time to time but we dont actually enjoy being flogged and we can fight like the bloody devil if you bastard lot started trusting us instead of treating us like the enemy youd be bloody amazed what we could do lawford said nothing youve got some good men in the company sharpe insisted tom garrard is a better soldier than half the officers in the battalion but you dont even notice him if a man cant read and doesnt speak like a bleeding choirboy you think he cant be trusted the armys changing lawford said defensively like hell it is why do you make us powder our hair like bleeding women or wear that bloody stock change takes time lawford said weakly too much bloody time sharpe said fervently then leaned against the wall and eyed the girls who were cooking at the taverns far end were they whores he wondered hickson and blake had told him they knew where the best whores were then he remembered mary and suddenly felt guilty he had not seen her once since their arrival in seringapatam but nor had he thought that much about her in truth he was having too good a time here the food was good the liquor cheap and the company acceptable and to that was added the heady spice of danger after that brilliant piece of sharpshooting he encouraged lawford were going to be all right well have a chance to get out of here what about mrs bickerstaff lawford asked i was just thinking of her and maybe you were right maybe i shouldnt have brought her couldnt leave her with the army though could i not with hakeswill planning to sell her to a kin a kin a pimp he really planned that lawford asked him and morris in it together they were bloody hakeswill told me as much the night he got me to hit him and morris was there with that little bastard hicks just waiting for me to do it i was a bloody fool to fall for it but there it is can you prove it prove it sharpe asked derisively of course i cant prove it but its true he blew out a rueful breath just what am i going to do with mary take her with you of course lawford said sternly might not have a chance sharpe said lawford stared at him for a few seconds god youre ruthless he finally said im a soldier it fits sharpe said it proudly but he was not proud merely defiant what was he to do with mary and where was she he drank the rest of his arrack and clapped his hands for more you want to find a bibbi tonight he asked lawford a whore lawford asked in horror i dont suppose a respectable woman will help us out much not unless you want a spot of polite conversation lawford stared aghast at sharpe what we should do the lieutenant said softly is find this man ravi shekhar he may have a way of getting news out of the city and how the hell are we supposed to find him sharpe asked defiantly we cant wander the bloody streets asking for this fellow in english no one will know what the heck were doing ill ask mary to find him when we see her he grinned bugger shekhar how about a bibbi instead maybe iii read your choice sharpe said carelessly lawford hesitated his face reddening its just that ive seen men with the pox he explained christ youve seen men vomit but it dont stop you drinking besides dont worry about the pox thats why god gave us mercury the stuff worked for bloody hakeswill didnt it though god knows why besides harry hickson says he knows some clean girls but of course they always say that still if you want to ruin your eyes reading the bible go ahead but there aint no mercury that will give you your sight back lawford said nothing for a few seconds maybe i will come with you he finally said shyly staring down at the table learning how the other half lives sharpe asked with a grin something like that lawford mumbled well enough i tell you give us some cash and a willing couple of frows and we can live like kings well make this the last drink eh dont want to lower the flag do we lawford was now deep red you wont of course tell anyone about this when were back me sharpe pretended to be astonished at the very idea my lips are gummed together not a word promise lawford worried that he was letting his dignity slide but he did not want to lose sharpes approval the lieutenant was becoming fascinated by the younger mans confidence and envied the way in which sharpe so instinctively negotiated a wicked world and he wished he could find the same easy ability in himself he thought briefly of the bible waiting back in the barracks and of his mothers advice to read it diligently but then he decided to hell with them both he drained his arrack picked up his musket and followed sharpe into the dusk every house in the city was prepared for the siege storehouses were filled with food and valuables were being hastily concealed in case the enemy armies broke through the wall holes were dug in gardens and filled with coins and jewellery and in some of the wealthier houses whole rooms were concealed by false walls so that the women could be hidden away when the invaders rampaged through the streets mary helped general appah raos household prepare for that ordeal she felt guilty not because she came from the army that was imposing this threatened misery on the city but because she had unexpectedly found herself happy in raos sprawling home when general appah rao had first taken her away from sharpe she had been frightened but the general had taken her to his own house and there reassured her of her safety we must clean you the general told her and let that eye heal he treated her gently but with a measure of reserve that sprang from her dishevelled looks and her presumed history the general did not believe that mary was the most suitable addition to his household but she spoke english and appah rao was shrewd enough to reckon that a command of english would be a profitable accomplishment in mysores future and he had three sons who would have to survive in that future in time rao told mary you can join your man but its best he should settle in first but now after a week in the generals household mary did not want to leave for a start the house was filled with women who had taken her into their care and treated her with a kindness that astonished her the generals wife lakshmi was a tall plump woman with prematurely grey hair and an infectious laugh she had two grown unmarried daughters and though there was a score of female servants mary was surprised to discover that lakshmi and her daughters shared the work of the big house they did not sweep it or draw water those tasks were for the lowest of the servants but lakshmi loved to be in the kitchen from where her laughter rippled out into the rest of the house it had been lakshmi who had scolded mary for being so dirty had stripped her from her western clothes forced her into a bath and there untangled and washed her filthy hair youd be beautiful if you took some trouble lakshmi had said i didnt want to draw attention to myself when youre my age my dear no one pays you any attention at all so you should take all you can get while youre young you say youre a widow he was an englishman mary said nervously explaining the lack of the marriage mark on her forehead and worried lest the older woman thought she should have thrown herself onto her husbands pyre well youre a free woman now so lets make you expensive lakshmi laughed and then helped by her daughters she first brushed and then combed marys hair drawing it back and then gathering it into a bun at the nape of her neck a cheerful maid brought in an armful of clothes and the women tossed cholis at her choose one lakshmi said the choli was a brief blouse that covered marys breasts shoulders and upper arms but left most of her back naked and mary instinctively selected the most modest but lakshmi would have none of it that lovely pale skin of yours show it off she said and chose a brief choli patterned in extravagant swirls of scarlet flowers and yellow leaves lakshmi tugged the short sleeves straight so why did you run with those two men lakshmi asked there was a man back in the army a bad man he wanted to mary stopped and shrugged you know soldiers lakshmi said disapprovingly but the two men you ran away with did they treat you well yes oh yes mary suddenly wanted lakshmis good opinion and that opinion would not be good if she thought that mary had run from the army with a lover one of them she told the lie shyly is my halfbrother ah lakshmi said as though everything was clear now her husband had told her that mary had run with her lover but lakshmi decided to accept marys story and the other man she asked hes just a friend of my brothers mary blushed at the lie but lakshmi did not seem to notice they were both protecting me mary explained thats good thats good now this she held out a white petticoat that mary stepped into lakshmi laced it tight at the back then began hunting through the pile of saris green she said thatll suit you and she unfolded a vast bolt of green silk that was four feet wide and over twenty feet long you know how to wear a sari lakshmi asked my mother taught me in calcutta lakshmi hooted what do they know of saris in calcutta skimpy little northern things thats all they are here let me lakshmi wrapped the first length of sari about marys slender waist and tucked it firmly into the petticoats waistband then she wrapped a further length about the girl but this she skilfully nicked into pleated folds that were again firmly anchored in the petticoats waistband mary could easily have done the job herself but lakshmi took such pleasure in it that it would have been cruel to have denied her by the time the pleats were tucked in about half of the sari had been used up and the rest lakshmi looped over marys left shoulder then tugged at the silk so that it fell in graceful folds then she stepped back perfect now you can come and help us in the kitchens well burn those old clothes in the mornings mary taught the generals three small boys english they were bright children and learned quickly and the hours passed pleasantly enough in the afternoons she helped in the household chores but in the early evening it was her job to light the oil lamps about the house and it was that duty that threw mary into the company of kunwar singh who at about the same time as the lamps were lit went round the house ensuring that the shutters were barred and the outer doors and gates either locked or guarded he was the chief of appah raos bodyguard but his duties were more concerned the the household than with the general who had enough soldiers surrounding him wherever he went in the city kunwar singh mary learned was a distant relation of the general but there was something oddly sad about the tall young man whose manners were so courteous but also so distant we dont talk about it lakshmi said to mary one afternoon when they were both hulling rice im sorry i asked his father was disgraced you see lakshmi went on enthusiastically and so the whole family was disgraced kunwars father managed some of our land near sedasseer and he stole from us stole and when he was found out instead of throwing himself on my husbands mercy he became a bandit the tippoos men caught him in the end and cut his head off poor kunwar its hard to live down that sort of disgrace is it a worse disgrace than having been married to an englishman mary asked miserably for somehow in this lively house she did feel obscurely ashamed she was half english herself but under lakshmis swamping affection she kept remembering her mother who had been rejected by her own people for marrying an englishman a disgrace married to an englishman what nonsense you do talk girl lakshmi said and the next day she took care to send mary to deliver a present of food to the young deposed rajah of mysore who survived at the tippoos mercy in a small house just east of the inner palace but you cant go alone lakshmi said not with the streets full of soldiers kunwar and lakshmi saw the blush of happiness on marys face as she set off in the tall kunwar singhs protective company mary was happy but she felt guilty she knew she ought to try and find shaipe for she suspected he must be missing her but she was suddenly so content in appah raos household that she did not want to disturb that happiness by returning to her old world she felt at home and though the city was surrounded by enemies she felt oddly safe one day she supposed she would have to find sharpe and perhaps everything would turn out well on that day but mary did nothing to hasten it she just felt guilty and made sure that she did not start lighting the lamps until she heard the first shutter bar fall and lakshmi who had been wondering just where she might find poor disgraced kunwar singh a suitable bride chuckled once the british and hyderabad armies had made their permanent encampment to the west of seringapatam the siege settled into a pattern that both sides recognized the allied armies stayed well out of the range of even the largest cannon on the citys wall and far beyond the reach of any rocket but they established a picquet line facing an earthbanked aqueduct that wended its way through the fields about a mile west of the city and there they posted some field artillery and infantry to cover the land across which they would dig their approach ditches the sooner those ditches were begun the sooner the breaching batteries could be built but to the south of that chosen ground the steeply banked aqueduct made a deep loop that penetrated a halfmile westwards and the inside of that bend was filled by a tope a thick wood and from its leafy cover the tippoos men kept up a galling musket fire on the british picquet line while his rocketmen rained an erratic but troublesome barrage of missiles onto the forward british works one lucky rocket streaked a thousand yards to hit an ammunition limber and the resultant explosion caused a cheer to sound from the distant walls of the city general harris endured the rocket bombardment for two days then decided it was time to capture the whole length of the aqueduct and clear the tope orders were written and trickled down from general to colonel to captains and the captains sought out their sergeants get the men ready sergeant morris told hakeswill hakeswill was sitting in his own tent a luxury he alone enjoyed among the rds sergeants the tent had belonged to captain hughes and should have been auctioned with the rest of the captains belongings after hughes died of the fever but hakeswill had simply claimed the tent and no one had liked to cross him his servant raziv a miserable halfwitted creature from calcutta was polishing hakeswills boots so the sergeant had to come barefooted from his tent to face morris ready sir he said they are ready sir he stared suspiciously about the light companys lines better be ready sir or well have the skin off the lot of them his face jerked sixty rounds of ammunition morris said always carry it sir regulations sir morris had drunk the best part of three bottles of wine at luncheon and was in no mood to deal with hakeswills equivocations he swore at the sergeant then pointed south to where another rocket was smoking up from the tope tonight you idiot were cleaning those bastards out of those trees us sir hakeswill was alarmed at the prospect just us sir the whole battalion night attack inspection at sundown any man who looks drunk gets flogged officers excepted hakeswill thought then quivered as he offered morris a cracking salute sir inspection at sundown sir permission to carry on sir he did not wait for morriss permission but turned back into his tent boots give em here come on you black bastard he gave raziv a cuff round the ear and snatched his halfcleaned boots he tugged them on then dragged raziv by the ear to where the halberd was planted like a banner in front of the tent sharpen hakeswill bawled in the unfortunate boys bruised ear sharpen understand you toadwitted heathen i want it sharp hakeswill gave the boy a parting slap as an encouragement then stumped off through the lines on your bleeding feet he shouted look lively now time to earn your miser able pay are you drunk garrard if youre drunk boy ill have your bones given a stroking the battalion paraded at dusk and to its surprise found itself being inspected by its colonel arthur wellesley there was a feeling of relief in the ranks when wellesley appeared for by now every man knew that they were due for a fight and none wished to go into battle under the uncertain leadership of major shee who had drunk so much arrack that he was visibly swaying on his horse wellesley might be a coldhearted bastard but the men knew he was a careful soldier and they even looked cheerful as he trotted down their ranks on his white horse each man had to demonstrate possession of sixty cartridges and those who failed had their names taken for punishment two sepoy battalions from the east india companys forces paraded behind the rd and just as the sun disappeared behind them all three battalions marched southeastwards towards the aqueduct their colours were flying and colonel wellesley led them on horseback other kings battalions marched to their left going to attack the northern stretch of the aqueduct so what are we doing lieutenant tom garrard asked the newly promoted lieutenant fitzgerald silence in the ranks hakeswill bawled he was talking to me sergeant fitzgerald said and you will do me the honour of not interfering in my private conversations fitzgeralds retort improved the irishmans stock with the company twentyfold he was popular anyway for he was a cheerful and easygoing young man hakeswill growled fitzgerald claimed his brother was the knight of kerry whatever the holy hell that was but the claim did not impress sergeant obadiah hakeswill proper officers left discipline to sergeants they did not curry favour with the men by telling jokes and chatting away like magpies it was also plain that brevetlieutenant bloody fitzgerald did not like sergeant hakeswill for he took every chance he could to countermand hakeswills authority and hakeswill was determined to change that the sergeants face twitched there was nothing he could do at this moment but mister fitzgerald he told himself would be taught his lesson and the sooner it was taught the better you see those trees ahead fitzgerald explained to garrard were going to clear the tippoos boys out of them how many of the bastards sir hundreds fitzgerald answered cheerfully and all of them quaking at the knees to think that the havercakes are coming to give them a thrashing the tippoos boys might be quaking but they could clearly see the three battalions approaching and their rocketmen sent up a fiery barrage in greeting the missiles climbed through the darkening sky their exhaust flames unnaturally bright as they spewed volcanoes of sparks into the smoke trails that mingled as the rockets reached their apogee and then plunged towards the british and indian infantry no breaking ranks an officer shouted and the three battalions marched stolidly on as the opening barrage plunged down to explode all around them some jeers greeted the barrages inaccuracy but the officers and sergeants shouted for silence more rockets climbed and fell most screamed erratically off course but a few came close enough to make men duck and one exploded just a few feet from the rds light company so that the sharpedged scraps of its shattered tin nose cone whistled about their ears men laughed at their narrow escape then someone saw that lieutenant fitzgerald was staggering sir its nothing boys nothing fitzgerald called a scrap of the rockets cylinder had torn open his left arm and there was a gash on the back of his head that was dripping blood from the ends of his hair but he shook off any help takes more than a black mans rocket to knock down an irishman he said happily aint that right oreilly it is sir the irish private answered got skulls like bloody buckets we have fitzgerald said and crammed his tattered shako back on his head his left arm was numb and blood had soaked his sleeve to the wrist but he was determined to keep going he had taken worse injuries on the hunting field and still been in his saddle at the death of the fox hakeswills resentment of fitzgerald seethed how dare a mere lieutenant overrule him a bloody child not nineteen years old yet and still with the bog water wet behind his ears hakeswill slashed at a cactus with his halberd and the savagery of the gesture dislodged the musket that was slung on his left shoulder the sergeant never usually carried a musket but tonight he was armed with the halberd the musket a bayonet and a brace of pistols except for the brief fight at malavelly it had been years since hakeswill had been in a battle and he was not sure he wanted to fight another this night but if he did then he would make damned sure that he carried more weapons than any heathen enemy he might meet the sun had long gone by the time wellesley halted the three battalions though a lambent light still suffused the western sky and under its pale glow the rd formed line the two sepoy battalions waited a quarter of a mile behind the rd the rocket trails seemed brighter now as they climbed into a cloudless twilight sky where the first few stars pricked the dark the missiles hissed as they streaked overhead their smoke trails made lurid by the spitting flames spent rockets lay on the ground with small pale flames flickering feebly from their exhausts the weapons were spectacular but so inaccurate that even the inexperienced rd no longer feared them but their relief was tempered by a sudden display of bright sparks at the lip of the aqueducts embankment the sparks were instantly extinguished by a cloud of powder smoke and the sound of musketry followed a few seconds later but the range was too great and the balls spent themselves harmlessly wellesley galloped his horse to major shees side spoke briefly then spurred on flank companies the colonel shouted advance in line thats us boys fitzgerald said and drew his sabre his left arm was throbbing now but he did not need it to fight with a blade he would keep going the grenadier and light companies advanced from the two flanks of the battalion wellesley halted them formed them into a line of two ranks and ordered them to load their muskets ramrods rattled into barrels fix bayonets the colonel called and the men drew out their seventeeninch blades and slotted them onto the musket muzzles it was full night now but the heat was still like a wet blanket the sound of slaps echoed through the ranks as men swatted at mosquitoes the colonel curbed his white horse at the front of the two ranks were going to chase the enemy off the embankment he said in his cold precise voice and once weve cleared them away major shee will bring on the rest of the battalion to drive the enemy out of the trees altogedier captain west sir francis west the commander of the grenadier company was senior to morris and so was in charge of the two companies you may advance at once sir west said detachment forward im in your hands mother hakeswill said under his breath as the two companies began their advance look after me now oh god in his heaven but the black bastards are firing at us mother its your obadiah here mother steady in the line sergeant greens voice called dont hurry keep your ranks morris had discarded his horse and drawn his sabre he felt distinctly unwell give them steel when we get there he called to his company we should give the buggers some bleeding artillery someone muttered who said that hakeswill shouted keep your bleeding tongues still the first balls were whistling past their ears now and the crackle of the enemys musketry filled the night the tippoos men were firing from the aqueducts embankment and the flames of their fusillade sparked bright against the dark background of the tope the two companies instinctively spread out as they advanced and the corporals charged to be fileclosers bawled at them to close up the ground was night dark but the skyline above the trees still showed clearly enough lieutenant fitzgerald glanced behind once and was appalled to see that the western sky was still touched by a blazing streak and he knew that crimson glow would silhouette the company once it climbed the embankment but there was no going back now he stretched his long legs eager to be first into the enemy lines wellesley was advancing behind the companies and fitzgerald wanted to impress the colonel the musketry fire blazed along the embankments lip each shot a spark of brightness that glowed briefly in the dark smoke but the fire was wildly inaccurate for the attackers were still in the nightshadowed low ground and concealed by the defenders own powder smoke far off to their left other battalions were assaulting the northern stretch of the embankment and fitzgerald heard a cheer as those men charged home then captain west gave the order to charge and the men of the rds two flank companies let loose their own cheer as they were released from the leash they ran hard towards the embankment musket balls whipped overhead all the redcoats wanted now was to get this attack over and done kill a few bastards loot a few bodies men get the hell back to the camp they cheered as they reached the embankment and clambered up its short steep slope kill them boys fitzgerald shouted as he reached the crest but there was suddenly no enemy there only a still stretch of dark gleaming water and as the attackers joined him they all checked rather than plunge into the aqueduct a blast of musketry erupted from the farther bank the light company poised on the lip of the western bank was silhouetted against the remnants of the daylight while the tippoos men were shrouded by the topes nightdark trees redcoats fell as the bullets thumped home the aqueduct was only about ten paces wide and at that range the mysorean infantry could not miss one man was lifted right off his feet and thrown back onto the ground behind the embankment rockets slashed across the dark water their fiery trails slicing just inches above the twin embankments for a few seconds no one knew what to do a man gasped as a rocket snatched off his foot then he slid down into the weedthick water where his blood swirled dark some redcoats fired back at the trees but they fired blind and their bullets hit nothing the wounded stumbled back down the embankment the dead twitched as they were struck by bullets while the living were dazed by the noise and dazzled by the rockets dreadful red tails captain morris stared in confusion he had somehow not expected to cross the aqueduct he had thought the trees were on this side of the water and he did not know what to do but then lieutenant fitzgerald gave a shout of defiance and jumped down into the waterway the black water came up to his waist come on boys come on theres not so many of the bastards he waded forward his naked sabre bright in the starlight lets flush them out come on havercakes follow him lads sergeant green shouted and about half the light company jumped into the greenscummed water the others crouched waiting for morriss orders but morris was still confused and sergeant hakeswill was crouching at the foot of the embankment out of the enemys sight go on wellesley shouted angered at their hesitation go on dont let them stand there captain west on on captain morris move oh jesus mother hakeswill called as he scrambled up the embankment mother mother he shouted as he dropped into the warm water fitzgerald and the first half of the company was already across the farther embankment and inside the tope now and hakeswill could hear shouts and shots and a chilling clash as steel scraped on steel wellesley saw his two flank companies at last advance across the aqueduct and he sent an aide back to summon major shee and the rest of the battalion the musket fire in the tope was dense an unending crackle of shots each flash momentarily illuminating the fog of powder smoke that spread between the leaves it looked like something from hell flash after flash of fire blooming in the dark rocket trails blazing among the trees and always the moans of dying men and shrieks of pain a sergeant yelled at his men to close up another man shouted desperately wanting to know where his comrades were fitzgerald was cheering his men forward but too many of the redcoats were being penned back against the embankment where they were in danger of being overwhelmed wellesley sensed he had done this all wrong he should have used the whole battalion instead of just the two flank companies and the realization of his mistake annoyed him he took pride in his profession but if a professional soldier could not hurl a few enemy infantry and rocketmen out of a small wood then what good was he he thought about spurring diomed his horse across the aqueduct and into the flaring smoke patches among the tope but he resisted the impulse for then he would be among the trees and out of touch with the rest of the rd and he knew he needed shees remaining eight companies to reinforce the attackers if necessary he could summon the two sepoy battalions as reinforcements but he was sure the remainder of the rd would be sufficient to retrieve victory from confusion and so he turned and galloped back to hurry the battalion forward hakeswill slithered down the farther embankment into the black shadows among the trees he held the musket in his left hand and the halberd in his right he crouched beside a tree trunk and tried to make sense of the chaos around him he could see muskets flashing their garish flames momentarily suffusing the smoke with light and glinting off the leaves he could hear a man crying and he could hear shouts but he had no idea what was happening a handful of his men had stayed close to him but hakeswill did not know what to tell them then a terrible war cry sounded close to his left and he whirled round to see a group of tigerstriped infantry charging towards him he screamed in pure panic fired the musket onehanded and dropped the weapon immediately as he fled into the trees to avoid the assault some of the redcoats scattered blindly but others were too slow and were overrun by the indians their shouts were cut short as bayonets did their work and hakeswill knowing that the tippoos men were slaughtering the small group of redcoats blundered desperately through the tangling trees to get clear captain morris was calling hakeswills name a note of panic in his voice tm here sir hakeswill called back tm here sir where here sir a volley of musketry crashed in the trees and the balls slashed through leaves and thumped into trunks rockets screamed up to clatter among the high branches their fiery exhausts blinded the men and the explosions of their powderfilled cones rained down shards of hot metal and fluttering scraps of leaves mother hakeswill shouted and shrank down beside a tree form line morris shouted form line he had a dozen men with him and they formed a nervous line and crouched among the trees the reflected flames of the burning rockets flickered red on their bayonets somewhere nearby a man panted as he died the blood bubbling in his gullet at the end of every laboured breath a volley crackled and splintered a few yards away but it was fired away from morris who nevertheless ducked then for a few blessed seconds the confusing noise of batde diminished and in the comparative silence morris looked around to try and find some bearings lieutenant fitzgerald he shouted tm here sir fitzgerald called confidently from the darkness ahead up afront of you cleared the buggers out of here sir but some of the rascals are working about your flank watch the left sir the irishman sounded indecently cheerful ensign hicks morris called tm here sir right beside you sir a small voice said from almost beneath morris jesus christ morris swore he had been hoping that hicks could have brought reinforcements but it seemed that no one except fitzgerald had any control in the chaos fitzgerald morris shouted still here sir got the buggers worried we have i want you here lieutenant morris insisted hakeswill where are you here sir hakeswill said but not moving from his hiding place among the bushes he guessed he was a few paces north of morris but hakeswill did not want to risk being ambushed by a tigerstriped soldier as he blundered about in search of his captain and so he stayed put coming to join you sir he called then crouched even lower among the shrouding leaves fitzgerald morris shouted irritably come here the bloody man fitzgerald said under his breath his left arm was useless now and he sensed it had been injured more badly than he had supposed he had ordered a man to tie a handkerchief round the wound and hoped the pressure would staunch the blood the thought of gangrene was nagging at him but he pushed that worry away to concentrate on keeping his men alive sergeant green sir green responded stoically stay with the men here sergeant fitzgerald ordered the irishman had led a score of the light company deep into the tope and he saw no point in surrendering the ground just because morris was nervous besides fitzgerald was fairly sure that the tippoos troops were just as confused as the british and if green stayed steady and used volley fire he should be safe enough iil bring the rest of the company back here fitzgerald promised sergeant green then the lieutenant turned and called back through the trees where are you sir here morris called irritably hurry damn you back in a minute sergeant fitzgerald reassured green and headed off through the trees in search of morris he strayed too far north and suddenly a rocket flared up from the topes eastern edge to lodge with a tearing crash among the tangling branches of a tall tree for a few seconds the trapped missile thrashed wildly startling scared birds up into the dark then it became firmly wedged in the crook of a branch the exhaust poured an impotent torrent of fire and smoke to illuminate a whole patch of the thick woodland and in the sudden blaze hakeswill saw the lieutenant stumbling towards him mister fitzgerald hakeswill called sergeant hakeswill fitzgerald asked its me sir right here sir this way sir thank god fitzgerald crossed the clearing at a run his left arm hanging useless at his side no one knows what the hell theyre doing or where they are i know what im doing sir hakeswill said and as the fierce crackling fire in the high leaves died away he lunged upwards with the halberds spear point at the lieutenants belly his face twitched as the newly sharpened blade ripped through the lieutenants clothes and into his stomach it isnt the soldierly thing sir to contradict a sergeant in front of his men sir he said respectfully you do understand that sir dont you sir hakeswill said and grinned with joy for the pleasure of the moment the spear point was deep in fitzgeralds belly so deep that hakeswill was certain he had felt its razorsharp point lodge against the mans backbone fitzgerald was on the ground now and his body was jerking like a gaffed and landed fish his mouth was opening and closing but he seemed unable to speak only to moan as hakeswill gave the spear a savage twist in an effort to free its blade we is talking about proper respect sir hakeswill hissed at the lieutenant respect sergeants must be supported sir says so in the scriptures sir dont worry sir wont hurt sir just a prick and he jerked the bloodied blade free and thrust it down again this time into the lieutenants throat wont be showing me up again sir will you sir not in front of the men sorry about that sir and good night sir fitzgerald morris shouted frantically for christs sake lieutenant where the hell are you hes gone to hell hakeswill chuckled softly he was searching the lieutenants body for coins he dared not take anything that might be recognized as the lieutenants property so he left the dead mans sabre and the gilded gorget he had worn about his throat but he did find a handful of unidentifiable small change which he pushed into his pouch before scrambling a few feet away to make sure no one saw him with his victim whos that morris called as he heard hakeswill pushing through the undergrowth me sir hakeswill called im looking for lieutenant fitzgerald sir come here instead morris snapped hakeswill ran the last few yards and dropped down between morris and a frightened ensign hicks tm worried about mister fitzgerald sir hakeswill said heard him up in the bushes and there was heathens there sir i know sir cos i killed a couple of the black bastards he flinched as some muskets flamed and banged some yards away but he could not tell who fired or at what you think the bastards found fitzgerald morris asked i reckon so hakeswill said poor little bastard i tried to find him sir but there was just heathens there jesus morris ducked as a volley of bullets flicked through the leaves overhead what about sergeant green probably skulking sir hiding his precious hide i dont wonder were all bloody skulking morris answered truthfully enough not me sir not obadiah hakeswill sir got me halberd proper wet sir want to feel it sir hakeswill held out the spear point heathen blood sir still warm morris shuddered at the thought of touching the spear but took some comfort in having hakeswill at his side the tope was filled with shouts as a group of the tippoos troops charged muskets hammered a rocket exploded nearby while another this one with a solid shot in its cone ripped through bushes and crashed into a tree a man screamed then the scream was abruptly chopped off jesus morris cursed uselessly maybe we should go back ensign hicks suggested back across the aqueduct cant sir hakeswill said buggers are behind us youre sure morris asked fought the black buggers there myself sir couldnt hold them a whole tribe of the bastards sir did my best lost some good men hakeswill sniffed with pretended emotion youre a brave man hakeswill morris said gruffly just following your lead sir hakeswill said then ducked as another enemy volley whipped overhead a huge cheer sounded followed by the screaming roar of rockets as the tippoos reinforcements sent from the city came shouting and fighting through the trees to drive every last infidel from the tope bleeding hell hakeswill said but not to worry i cant die sir i cant die behind him there was another cheer as the rest of the rd at last crossed the aqueduct forward a voice shouted from somewhere behind the light companys scattered fugitives forward bloody hell morris snapped who the hell is that rd the voice shouted to me to me stay where you are morris called to a few eager men and so they crouched in the warm dark that was loud with the ripping of bullets and filled by the whimpers of dying men and bright with the glare of rockets and foul with the stench of blood that was being spilt in a black place where only chaos and fear prevailed chapter sharpe sharpe it was colonel gudin who at nightfall burstinto the barracks room come quick as you are hurry what about me sir lawford asked the lieutenant had been idly reading his bible as he lay on his cot come on sharpe gudin did not wait to answer lawford but just ran across the barracks courtyard and out into the street which separated the european soldiers quarters from the hindu temple quick sharpe the frenchman called back as he hurried past a pile of mud bricks that were stacked at the street corner sharpe dressed in tigerstriped tunic and boots but with no hat crossbelt pouches or musket ran after the colonel he leapt over a halfnaked man who was sitting crosslegged beside the temple wall shoved a cow out of his way then turned the corner and hurried after gudin towards the mysore gate lawford had paused to tug on his boots and by the time he reached the street beside the temple sharpe had already vanished can you ride a horse gudin shouted at sharpe when the two men reached the gate i did a couple of times sharpe said not bothering to explain that the beasts had been unsaddled draught horses that had ambled docilely around the inn yard get on that one gudin said pointing to a small excited mare that was being held by an indian infantryman along with gudins own horse she belongs to captain romet so for gods sake take care gudin shouted as he swung himself up into the saddle captain romet was one of gudins two deputies but as both the junior french officers spent most of their lives in the citys most expensive brothel sharpe had yet to meet either of them he climbed gingerly onto the mares back then kicked back his heels and clung desperately to the horses mane as she followed gudins gelding into the gateway the british are attacking a wood just north of sultanpetah the colonel explained as he pushed his horse through the crowded archway sharpe could hear the distant fight muskets snapped and shells exploded dully to flicker red bursts of light far to the citys west it was very nearly night in the city the first house lamps had long been lit and flaming torches smoked in the archway of the mysore gate through which a stream of men was hurrying some were infantry others carried rockets gudin bellowed at them for passage used his gelding to force the slower rocketmen aside and then once through the gate he sawed on his reins to turn westwards sharpe followed more intent on staying on the mare than watching the excitement that seethed around him a narrow bridge led across the south cauvery just outside the gate and gudin shouted at its guards to clear the roadway rocketmen shrank back against the balustrades as sharpe and gudin hurried between the bridges small forts and then over the shallow shrunken river once on the far bank they galloped hard across a stretch of muddy grass then splashed through anodier small branch of the river sharpe clung to the mares neck as she lurched up out of the stream rockets were flaring in the sky ahead which still glowed from the last rays of the invisible sun your old friends are trying to clear the tope gudin explained pointing at the thick wood that showed black against the eastern skyline he had slowed down for now they were crossing more uneven ground and the colonel did not want to break a horses leg by being too reckless i want you to confuse them me sir sharpe slipped half out of the saddle gripped the pommel desperately and somehow dragged himself upright he could hear the snapping crack of muskets and see the small muzzle flames flickering all across the land ahead it seemed to him like a major attack especially when a british field gun fired in the distance and its muzzle flame lit the twilight like sheet lightning shout orders at them sharpe gudin said when the report of the gun had rolled past them confuse them lawford would have done better sir sharpe said hes got a voice like an officer then youll have to sound like a sergeant gudin said and if you do it right sharpe ill make you up to corporal thank you sir gudin had slowed his horse to a walk as they neared the wood it was too dark to trot now and there was a danger they could lose their way to sharpes north where the field gun had fired the musketry was regular suggesting that the british soldiers or sepoys were steadily taking their objectives but in the wood in front there seemed to be nothing but confusion muskets crackled irregularly rockets streaked fire amongst the branches and smoke boiled from small brush fires sharpe could hear men shouting either in fear or triumph i wouldnt mind a gun sir he said to gudin you dont need one were not here to fight just to mix them up thats why i came back to get you dismount here the colonel tied both horses reins to an abandoned handcart that must have been used to bring more rockets forward the two men were a hundred yards short of the tope now and sharpe could hear officers shouting orders it was hard to tell who was giving the orders for the tippoos army used english words of command but as sharpe and gudin hurried closer to the fight sharpe could tell that it was indian voices that shouted the commands to fire to advance and to kill whatever british or indian troops were trying to capture the wood were evidently in trouble and it had been gudins inspiration to snatch the first englishman he could find in the barracks and use him to sow even more confusion among the attackers gudin drew a pistol sergeant rothiere he called man colonel the big sergeant who had first used captain romets horse to reach the fight materialized out of the gloom he gave sharpe a suspicious glowering look then cocked his musket lets enjoy ourselves gudin said in english aye sir sharpe said and wondered what the hell he should do now in the dark he reckoned there should be no trouble in slipping away from the colonel and rothiere and joining the beleaguered attackers but how would that leave lieutenant lawford the trick of it sharpe decided was not to make it look as though he was deliberately trying to get back to the british but rather to make it seem as though he was captured accidentally that still might make things very awkward for lawford but sharpe knew that his overriding duty was to carry mccandlesss warning to general harris just as he knew that he might never get another opportunity as good as this one that gudin had dropped so unexpectedly into his lap gudin paused at the edge of the tope rocketmen were enthusiastically blasting their weapons through the trees where the missiles were being deflected off branches to tumble erratically through the leaves muskets sounded deep inside the wood wounded men lay at the trees edge and somewhere not far off a dying man alternately screamed and panted so far gudin said we seem to be beating them lets go forward sharpe followed the two frenchmen off to his right there was a sudden blast of gunfire and the sound of bayonets clashing and gudin swerved towards the sound but the fight was over before they even reached it the tippoos men had encountered a small group of redcoats and had killed one and chased the others deeper into the wood gudin saw the redcoats body in the fastdying flame light of an exhausted rocket and knelt beside the man the colonel took out a tinderbox struck a spark blew the charred linen in the box alight then held the tiny flame down beside the redcoats chest the man was not quite dead but he was unconscious blood was bubbling slow in his throat and his eyes were closed recognize the uniform gudin asked sharpe the tinderboxs flickering glow revealed that the redcoats turnbacks and facings were scarlet piped with white bloody hell sharpe said excuse me sir he added then he gently moved gudins hand up to the dying mans face blood had poured out of the mans mouth to soak his powdered hair but sharpe recognized him all the same it was jed mallinson who usually paraded in the rearmost rank of sharpes file i know the uniform and the man sir sharpe told gudin its the rd my old battalion west riding yorkshire good gudin snapped the tinderbox shut extinguishing the small flame and you dont mind confusing them thats why im here sir sharpe said with a suitable bloodthirstiness i think the british army lost a good man in you sharpe gudin said standing and guiding sharpe deeper into the trees if you dont want to stay in india you might think of coming home with me to france sir gudin smiled at sharpes surprised tone it isnt the devils country sharpe indeed i suspect its the most blessed place on gods earth and in the french army a good man can be very easily raised to officer rank me sir an officer sharpe laughed like making a mule into a racehorse you underestimate yourself gudin paused there were feet trampling to the right and a sudden blast of musketry off to the left the musketry attracted an excited rush of the tippoos infantry who blundered through the trees sergeant rothiere bellowed at them in a mix of french and kanarese and his sudden authority calmed the men who gathered around colonel gudin gudin smiled wolfishly lets see if we can mislead some of your old comrades sharpe shout at them to come this way forward sharpe obediently bellowed into the dark trees forward he paused listening for an answer rd to me to me no one responded try a name gudin suggested sharpe invented an officers name captain fellows this way he called it a dozen times but there was no response hakeswill he finally shouted sergeant hakeswill then from maybe thirty paces away the hated voice called back whos that the sergeant sounded suspicious come here man sharpe snapped hakeswill ignored the order but me fact that a man had replied at all cheered gudin who had quiedy formed the stray unit of the tippoos infantry into a line that waited to kill whoever came in response to sharpes hailing chaos reigned ahead rockets banged into branches musket flames flared in the drifting smoke while bullets thumped into trees or crackled through the thick leaves a bloodthirsty cheer sounded a long way off but whether it was indian or british troops who cheered sharpe could not tell one thing was plain to sharpe the rd was in trouble poor jed mallinson should never have been abandoned to die and that sad death along with the scattered sounds of firing suggested that the tippoos men had succeeded in splitting the attacking force and was now picking it off piece by piece it was now or never sharpe reckoned he had to get away from gudin and somehow rejoin his battalion i need to get closer sir he told the colonel and without waiting for gudins consent he ran deeper into the trees sergeant hakeswill he shouted as he ran to me now now come on you miserable bastard move your bloody self come on he could hear gudin following him so sharpe fell silent and suddenly deep in shadow dodged off to his right sharpe gudin hissed but sharpe was well away from the colonel now and he reckoned he had done it without looking like a deserter sergeant hakeswill sharpe bellowed then ran on again there was a danger that by shouting he would keep gudin on his heels but it was a greater danger to let the frenchman think that he was deliberately trying to rejoin the british for then lawford might suffer and so sharpe ran the risk as he worked his way still farther into the dense trees hakeswill to me to me he pushed through thick foliage tripped over a bush picked himself up and ran on into a clearing hakeswill he shouted a rocket crashed into a branch high above sharpe and slashed straight down into the clearing ahead of him once on the ground the missile circled furiously like a mad dog chasing its own tail and the brilliant light of the exhaust lit the trees all around sharpe flinched away from the lash of the fiery tail and almost ran straight into sergeant hakeswill who had suddenly appeared from the bushes to his left sharpie hakeswill shouted you bastard he slashed wildly at sharpe with his bloody halberd morris hearing hakeswills name shouted had ordered the sergeant to find whoever was summoning him and hakeswill had unwillingly obeyed now suddenly hakeswill was alone with sharpe and the sergeant slammed the spear forward again traitorous little bastard hakeswill said for christs sake drop it sharpe shouted retreating before the quick lunges of the spear head running off to the enemy sharpie hakeswill said i should take you in shouldnt i itll be another court martial and a firing party this time but i wont risk that im going to put your gizzards on a skewer sharpie and send you back to your maker and wearing a frock too the sergeant stabbed again and sharpe leapt back once more but then the dying rocket fizzed across the clearing and its long bamboo stick tangled sharpes legs he fell backwards and hakeswill gave a shout of triumph as he sprang towards him with the halberd poised ready to lunge downwards sharpe felt the rockets iron tube under his right hand gripped it and threw it up at hakeswills face the rockets gunpowder fuel was almost gone but there was just enough left to spurt one last sudden flame that licked across hakeswills blueeyed face the sergeant screamed dropped the halberd and clapped his hands to his eyes to his surprise he discovered he could still see and that his face was not badly burned but in his panic he had stumbled past sharpe and so now he turned back and as he did so he dragged a pistol out of his belt just then a squad of redcoats burst into the clearing the burning carcass of the rocket showed that they were men from the rds grenadier company who were as lost as every other redcoat on this night of chaos one of the grenadiers saw sharpe who in his tigerstriped tunic was scrambling to his feet the grenadier raised his gun leave the bastard hakeswill screamed hes mine then a volley of musketry flamed from the trees and half of the grenadiers spun round or were hurled backwards blood hissed in the fiery remnants of the rocket as a company of tigerstriped troops burst out of the trees colonel gudin and sergeant rothiere led them hakeswill turned to run at the sight of the enemy but one of the tippoos men lunged forward with a bayonettipped musket and succeeded in driving the sergeant down to the ground where he first twisted frantically aside then screamed for mercy gudin ran past the fallen hakeswill well done sharpe gudin called well done stop that stop that these last orders were to the tippoos men who had enthusiastically begun to bayonet the surviving grenadiers we take prisoners gudin roared prisoners rothiere knocked a bayonet aside to stop the soldier from slaughtering hakeswill sharpe was cursing he had so nearly got clean away if hakeswill had not attacked him he might have run another fifty yards through the trees discarded the tigerstriped tunic and discovered some of his old friends instead he had become a hero to gudin who believed that sharpe had lured all the grenadiers into the clearing where the twelve who had survived the enthusiastic attack were now prisoners along with the twitching and cursing hakeswill you took a terrible risk corporal gudin said coming back to sharpe and sheathing his sword you could have been shot by your old friends but it worked eh and now you are a corporal aye sir it worked sharpe said though he took no pleasure in it it had all gone so disastrously wrong indeed the whole night had gone disastrously wrong for the british the tippoos men were now clearing the tope yard by yard and chasing british survivors back across the aqueduct they pursued the beaten fugitives with jeers volleys of musket fire and salvoes of rockets thirteen prisoners had been taken all by sharpe and gudin and those unfortunate men were herded back towards the city while the redcoat dead were looted for weapons and valuables iil make sure the tippoo hears of your bravery sharpe gudin said as he retrieved his horse hes a brave man himself and he admires it in others i dont doubt hell want to reward you thank you sir sharpe said though without enthusiasm youre not wounded are you gudin asked anxiously struck by the forlorn tone of sharpes voice burned my hand sir sharpe said he had not realized it when he snatched up the rocket tube to fend off hakeswill but the metal cylinder had scorched his hand though not badly nothing much he added iil live of course youll live gudin said then laughed delightedly gave them a beating didnt we trounced em proper sir and well trounce them again sharpe when they attack the city they dont know whats waiting for them what is waiting for them sir sharpe asked youll see youll see gudin said then hauled himself up into his saddle sergeant rothiere wanted to stay in the tope to retrieve british muskets so the colonel insisted that sharpe ride the second horse back to the city with the disconsolate prisoners who were under the guard of a gleeful company of the tippoos troops hakeswill looked up at sharpe and spat bloody traitor ignore him gudin said snake hakeswill hissed piece of nogood shit thats what you are sharpie jesus christ this last imprecation was because one of the escorting soldiers had hit the back of hakeswills head with a musket barrel black bastard hakeswill muttered id like to kick his bloody teeth in sir sharpe said to gudin in fact if youve no objection sir ill take the bastard into the dark and finish him off gudin sighed i do object the colonel said mildly because its rather important we treat prisoners well sharpe i sometimes fear the tippoo doesnt understand the courtesies of war but so far ive managed to persuade him that if we treat our prisoners properly then our enemies will treat theirs properly in return id still like to kick the bastards teeth in sir i assure you the tippoo might do that without any help from you gudin said grimly sharpe and the colonel spurred ahead of the prisoners to cross the bridge back to the city where they dismounted at the mysore gate sharpe handed the mares reins to gudin who thanked him yet again and tossed him a whole golden haideri as a reward go and get drunk sharpe the colonel said you deserve it thank you sir and believe me ill tell the tippoo he admires bravery lieutenant lawford was among the curious crowd who waited just inside the gate what happened he asked sharpe i buggered up sharpe said bitterly i bloody well buggered it up come on lets spend some money get drunk no wait lawford had seen the redcoats coming through the flame light of the gate torches and he pulled away from sharpe to watch as the thirteen prisoners were pushed at bayonet point into the city the crowd began jeering come away sharpe insisted and he tugged at lawfords elbow lawford shook off the tug and stared at the prisoners unable to hide his chagrin at the sight of british soldiers being herded into captivity then he recognized hakeswill who at the same instant stared into the lieutenants face and sharpe saw hakeswills look of utter astonishment for a second the world seemed to pause in its turning lawford appeared unable to move while hakeswill was gaping with disbelief and seemed about to shout his recognition sharpe was reaching to snatch a musket from one of the tippoos infantrymen but then hakeswill turned deliberately away and composed his features as though sending a silent message that he would not remark on lawfords presence the twelve grenadier prisoners were still a few yards behind and lawford suddenly realizing that yet more men of his battalion might recognize him at last turned away he pulled sharpe with him sharpe protested i want to kill hakeswill come on lawford hurried down an alley the lieutenant had gone pale he stopped beside the arched doorway of a small temple that was surmounted by a carving of a cow resting beneath a parasol little flames sputtered inside the sanctuary will he say anything lawford asked that bastard sharpe said anythings possible surely not he wouldnt betray us lawford said then shuddered what happened for gods sake sharpe told him of the nights events and how close he had come to making a clean break back to the british lines tt were bloody hakeswill that stopped me he complained he could have misunderstood you lawford said not him but what happens if he does betray us lawford asked then we join your uncle in the bloody cells sharpe said gloomily you should have let me shoot the bastard back at the gate dont be a fool lawford snapped youre still in the army sharpe so am i he suddenly shook his head god almighty he swore we need to find ravi shekhar why because if we cant get the news out then maybe he can lawford said angrily his anger was at himself he had been so beguiled by exploring the existence of a common soldier that he had forgotten his duty and that dereliction now filled him with guilt we have to find him sharpe how we cant ask in the streets for him then find mrs bickerstaff lawford said urgently find her sharpe he lowered his voice and thats an order i outrank you sharpe said lawford turned on him furiously what did you say im a corporal now private sharpe grinned this is not a joke sharpe lawford snapped there was a sudden authority in his voice were not here to enjoy ourselves were here to do a job weve done it bloody well so far sharpe said defensively no we havent lawford said firmly because we havent got the news out have we and until we do that sharpe weve achieved nothing absolutely nothing so talk to your woman and tell her what we know and get her to find shekhar thats an order private sharpe so do it lawford abruptly turned and stalked away sharpe felt the comforting weight of the haideri in his tunic pocket he thought about following lawford then decided to hell with it tonight he could afford the best and life was too short to pass up that sort of chance he decided he would go back to the brothel he had liked the place a house filled with curtains rugs and shaded oil lamps where two giggling girls had given lawford and sharpe baths before letting them go up the stairs to the bedrooms a haideri would buy a whole night in one of those rooms perhaps with lali the tall girl who had left lieutenant lawford exhausted and guiltridden so he went to spend his gold the rd marched unhappily back to the encampment the wounded were carried or limped back and one man cried out every time he put his left foot down but otherwise the battalion was silent they had been whipped and the distant jeers of the tippoos men rubbed salt into their wounds a last few rockets pursued them their flames streaking wildly askew across the stars the grenadier and light companies had taken the casualties men were missing and wellesley knew that some of those missing were dead and he feared that others were prisoners or else still lying wounded among the dark trees the remaining eight companies of the battalion had marched to support the flank companies but in the dark they had crossed the aqueduct too far to the south and while wellesley had tried to find his beleaguered flank companies major shee had stolidly marched straight through the tope and out across the aqueduct on the far side without encountering the enemy or firing a shot the two sepoy battalions could easily have turned the nights disaster into a victory but they had received no orders though one of the battalions fearing disaster had fired a panicked volley that had killed their own commanding officer while a halfmile to their front the rd had floundered about in unsoldierlike chaos it was that lack of professionalism that galled wellesley he had failed the northern stretch of the aqueduct had been efficiently captured by other battalions but the rd had blundered wellesley had blundered and he knew it general harris was sympathetic enough when the young colonel reported his failure harris murmured about the uncertainty of night attacks and how everything could be put right in the morning but wellesley still felt the failure keenly he knew only too well that experienced soldiers like baird despised him believing that his promotion to secondincommand was due solely to the fact that his elder brother was governorgeneral of the british regions in india and wellesleys shame had been made worse because major general baird had been waiting with harris when wedesley arrived to report his failure and the tall scotsman seemed to smirk as wellesley confessed to the nights disasters difficult things night attacks harris said yet again while baird said nothing and wellesley smarted under the scotsmans telling silence well clear the tope in the morning harris tried to console wellesley my men will do it wellesley promised quickly no no they wont be rested harris said better if we use fresh troops my fellows will be quite ready baird spoke for the first time he smiled at wellesley the scotch brigade i mean i request permission to command the attack sir wellesley said very stiffly ignoring baird whatever troops you use sir ill still be duty officer im sure im sure harris said vaguely neither granting nor denying wellesleys request you must get some sleep he said to the young colonel so let me wish you a restful night he waited till wellesley was gone then shook his head mutely a whippersnapper baird said loudly enough for the retreating colonel to hear him with his nursery maids apron strings still trapped in his sword belt hes very efficient harris said mildly my mother was efficient god rest her soul baird retorted vigorously but you wouldnt want her running a damned battle i tell you harris if you let him lead the assault on the city youll be asking for trouble give the job to me man give it to me ive got a score to settle with the tippoo so you have harris agreed so you have and let me take the damned tope in the morning god man i could do it with a corporals guard wellesley will still be officer of the day tomorrow morning baird harris said then pulled off his wig as a sign that he wanted to go to bed one side of his scalp was curiously flattened where he had been wounded at bunker hill he scratched at the old injury then yawned til bid you good night you know how to spell wellesleys name for the despatch harris baird asked three ls good night harris said firmly at dawn the scotch brigade and two indian battalions paraded east of the encampment while a battery of four twelvepounder guns unlimbered to their south as soon as the sun was up the four guns began throwing shells into the tope the missiles left filmy smoke traces in the air from their burning fuses then plunged into the trees where their explosions were muffled by the thick foliage one shell fell short and a great gout of water spurted up from the aqueduct birds wheeled above the smoking tope squawking their pro tests at the violence that had once again disturbed their nests major general baird waited in front of the scotch brigade he itched to take his countrymen forward but harris insisted it was wellesleys privilege hes officer of the day till noon harris said he aint up baird said hes sleeping it off if you wait for him to wake up itll be past noon anyway just let me go sir give him five minutes harris insisted i sent an aide to wake him baird had intercepted the aide to make certain wellesley did not wake in time but just before the five minutes expired the young colonel came racing across the ground on his white horse he looked dishevelled like a man who had made too hasty a toilet my sincerest apologies sir he greeted harris youre ready wellesley indeed sir then you know what to do harris said curdy look after my scots boys baird called to wellesley and received as he expected no answer the scots colours were unfurled the drummer boys sounded the advance the pipers began their fierce music and the brigade marched into the rising sun the sepoys followed rockets streaked up from the tope but the missiles were no more accurate in the morning than they had been at night the four brass field guns fired shell after shell only stopping when the scotsmen reached the aqueduct harris and baird watched as the brigade attacked in a fourdeep line that climbed the nearer embankment dropped out of sight into the aqueduct briefly reappeared on the farther embankment then finally disappeared into the trees beyond for a few moments there was the disciplined sound of musket volleys then silence the sepoys followed the scots spreading left and right to attack the fringes of the battered woodland harris waited then a galloper came from the northern stretch of the aqueduct which had been captured during the night to report that the land between the tope and the city was thick with enemy fugitives running back to seringapatam that news was proof that the tope was at last taken and that the whole aqueduct was now in allied hands time for breakfast harris said happily youll join me baird iii hear the butchers bill first sir if you dont mind baird answered but there was no butchers bill for none of the scots or indian troops had died the tippoos men had abandoned the tope once the artillery shells began to fall among the trees and they left behind only the plundered british dead of the previous night lieutenant fitzgerald was among them and he was buried with honours killed by an enemy bayonet the report said and now with the approach ground west of the city in harriss hands the siege proper could begin it did not prove difficult to find mary shaipe merely asked gudin and after the nights events in the tope the colonel was eager to give sharpe whatever he wanted the loss of the tope the following dawn had in no way diminished the frenchmans delight at the nighttime victory nor the optimism inside the city for no one had seriously expected the tope to resist for more than a few minutes and the previous nights victory with its catch of prisoners and its tales of british defeat had convinced the tippoos forces that they would prove more than a match for the enemy armies your woman sharpe gudin teased you become a corporal and all you want is your woman back i just want to see her sir shes in appah raos household ill have a word with the general but first youre to go to the palace at midday me sir sharpe felt an instant pang of alarm fearing that hakeswill had betrayed him to get an award sharpe gudin reassured him but dont worry ill be there to steal most of your glory yes sir sharpe grinned he liked gudin and he could not help contrasting the kind and easygoing frenchman with his own colonel who always appeared to treat common soldiers as if they were a nuisance that had to be endured of course wellesley was sheltered from his ranks by his officers and sergeants while gudin had such a small battalion that in truth he was more like a captain than a colonel gudin did have the assistance of a swiss adjutant and the occasional help of the two french captains when they were not drinking in the citys best brothel but the battalion had no lieutenants or ensigns and only three sergeants which meant that the rank and file had an unprecedented access to their colonel gudin liked it that way for he had litde else to occupy him officially he was frances adviser to the tippoo but the tippoo rarely sought anyones advice gudin confessed as much as he walked with sharpe to the palace at midday knows it all does he sir sharpe asked hes a good soldier sharpe very good what he really wants is a french army not a french adviser what does he want a french army for sir to beat you british out of india but then hed just be stuck with you french instead sharpe pointed out but he likes the french sharpe you find that strange i find everything in india strange sir havent had a proper meal since i got here gudin laughed and a proper meal is what bit of beef sir with some potatoes and a gravy thick enough to choke a rat gudin shuddered la cuisine anglaise sir never mind sharpe never mind a halfdozen men waited to be presented to the tippoo all of them soldiers who had somehow distinguished themselves in the defence of the tope the previous night there was also one prisoner a hindu soldier who had been seen to run away when the attackers had first crossed the aqueduct all of them coward and heroes alike waited in the courtyard where sharpe and lawford had been tested by the tippoo though today five of the six tigers had been taken away leaving only a big old docile male gudin crossed to the beast and tickled its chin then scratched it between the ears this ones tame as a cat sharpe ill let you stroke it sir wild horses wouldnt get me near a beast like that the tiger liked being scratched it closed its yeeow eyes and for a few seconds sharpe could almost persuade himself the big beast was purring then it yawned hugely displaying a massive mouth with old worn teeth and when it had yawned it stretched out its long forepaws and from its furry pads two sets of long hooked claws emerged thats how it kills gudin said gesturing at the claws as he backed away holds you down with its teeth then slits your belly open with the claws not this one though hes just an old soft pet fleabitten too gudin picked a flea off his hand then turned as a doorway to the courtyard was opened and a procession of palace attendants filed into the sunlight it was led by two robed men who carried staffs tipped with silver tiger heads they served as chamberlains mustering the heroes into line and pushing the coward to one side and behind them came two extraordinary men sharpe gaped at them they were both huge tall and muscled like prizefighters their dark skin naked to their waists was oiled to a glistening shine while their long black hair had been twisted round and round their heads and then tied with white ribbons they had bristling black beards and wide moustaches that had been stiffened into points with wax jettis gudin whispered to sharpe god almighty sharpe said in wonderment as he watched the mans head being wrung like a chicken he had never seen such a thing nor dreamed it was even possible behind him colonel gudin made a small noise of disapproval but sharpe had been impressed it was a quicker death than being flogged and quicker too than most hangings where the prisoners were left to dangle and dance as the rope choked them the tippoo applauded thcjettf s display rewarded him then ordered the dead man to be dragged away then one by one the nights heroes were led up to the tigerstriped canopy and to the short plump man who stood in its shade each soldier knelt as he was named and each time the tippoo leaned down and used both hands to lift the man up before talking to him and presenting the hero with a large medallion the medallions looked as if they were gold but sharpe guessed they had to be made of polished brass for surely no one would give away that much gold each of the men kissed the gift then shuffled backwards to his place in the line at last it was sharpes turn you know what to do gudin said encouragingly sharpe did he disliked going on his knees to any man let alone this plump little monarch who was his countrys enemy but there was no future in unnecessary defiance and so he obediently went down on one knee the yellowwhite stone in the daggers hilt glinted at him and sharpe could have sworn it was a real diamond a huge diamond then the tippoo smiled leaned forward and raised sharpe by putting his hands under his armpits he was surprisingly strong gudin had come forward with sharpe and now spoke to the tippoos interpreter in french and the interpreter translated into persian which left sharpe none the wiser so far as he was concerned the events of the previous night had been a shambles but it was evident that gudin was telling a tale of high heroics for the tippoo kept giving sharpe appreciative glances sharpe stared back in fascination the tippoo had grey eyes a dark skin and a finely trimmed black moustache at a distance he looked plump even soft but closer there was a grimness to his face which persuaded sharpe that colonel gudin had been right when he claimed that this man was a fine soldier sharpe towered over the tippoo so much that if he looked straight ahead he found himself gazing at the huge stone in the tippoos plume it did not look like glass it looked like one giant ruby the size of a piece of grapeshot it was held in a delicate gold clasp and had to be worth a bloody fortune sharpe remembered his promise to give mary a proper ruby on the day he married her and he almost grinned at the thought of stealing the tippoos stone then he forgot the stone as the tippoo asked some questions but sharpe was not required to answer for colonel gudin did all his speaking for him once the questions were answered the tippoo looked up into sharpes eyes and spoke directly to him he says gudin translated the interpreters words that you have proved yourself a worthy soldier of mysore he is proud to have you in his forces and he looks forward to the day when with the infidel beaten back from the city you can become a full and proper member of his army does that mean ill have to be circumvented sir sharpe asked it means you are extraordinarily grateful to his majesty as i shall now tell him gudin said and duly did so and when that statement had been translated the tippoo smiled and turned to an attendant took the last of the medallions from its silklined basket and reached up to put it round sharpes neck sharpe stooped to make it easier and blushed as the tippoos face came close he could smell a pungent perfume on the monarch then sharpe stepped back and just like the other soldiers he lifted the medallion to his lips he almost swore as he did so for the thing was not made of brass at all but of heavy gold back away gudin muttered sharpe bowed to the tippoo and backed clumsily to his place in the line the tippoo spoke again though this time no one bothered to translate for sharpe and then the small ceremony was over and the tippoo turned and went back into his palace you are now officially a hero of mysore gudin said drily one of the tippoos beloved tigers dont deserve to be sir sharpe said peering at the medallion one side was patterned with an intricate design while the other showed a tigers face though the face seemed to be cunningly constructed from the whorls of an intricate script does it say something sir he asked gudin it says sharpe assad allah alghalib which is arabic and it means the lion of god is victorious lion not tiger its a verse from the koran sharpe the muslim bible and i suspect the holy book does not mention tigers it cant otherwise im sure the tippoo would use the quotation funny isnt it sharpe said peering at the heavy gold medallion what is the british beast is the lion sir sharpe chuckled then hefted the gold in his hand is he a rich bugger the tippoo as rich as can be gudin said drily and those are real stones that ruby in his hat and the diamond in his dagger both worth a kings ransom sharpe but be careful the diamond is called the moonstone and is supposed to bring ill luck to anyone who steals it i wasnt thinking of thieving it sir sharpe said though he had been thinking exactly that but what about this he lifted the heavy medallion again do i get to keep it of course you do though i might say you only received it because i somewhat exaggerated your exploits sharpe unlooped the medallion you can have it sir he pushed the heavy gold towards the frenchman really sir go on gudin backed away and held up his hands in horror if the tippoo discovered you had given it away sharpe he would never forgive you never thats a badge of honour you must wear it always the colonel pulled out a breguet watch and clicked open its lid i have duties sharpe and that reminds me your woman will be waiting for you in the small temple beside appah raos house you know where that is no sir go to the north side of the big hindu temple the colonel said and keep walking you will come almost to the city wall turn left there and you will see the temple on your left it has one of those cows over the gate why do they put cows over the gates sir for the same reason we put images of a tortured man in our churches religion you ask too many questions sharpe the colonel smiled your woman will meet you there but remember corporal guard duty at sundown with those words gudin strode away and sharpe with one final glance at the somnolent tiger followed it was not hard to find the small temple that lay opposite an old gateway that led through the western defences it was these walls that mccandless had warned against but sharpe staring at them from the temple entrance could see nothing strange about them a long ramp ran up to the firestep and a pair of soldiers were struggling to push a handcart loaded with rockets to the ramparts where a dozen great guns stood unattended in their embrasures but he could see nothing sinister no trap to destroy an army one of the tippoos sunblazoned flags flew on a tall staff above the gatehouse itself flanked by two smaller green flags that showed a silver device the wind lifted one of the flags and sharpe saw it was the same calligraphic tiger head that was engraved on his medal he grinned that was something to show mary he went into the temple but mary had not yet arrived sharpe found a patch of shade in a niche to one side of the open courtyard from where he watched a starknaked man with a white stripe painted across his bald pate who was sitting crosslegged in front of an idol that had a mans body a monkeys head and was painted red green and yellow another god this one with seven cobra heads stood in a niche that was littered with fading flowers the crosslegged man did not move sharpe could swear he did not even blink not even when two other worshippers came to the temple one was a tall slim woman in a palegreen sari with a small diamond glinting in the side of her nose her companion was a tall man dressed in the tippoos tigerstriped tunic with a musket slung on one shoulder and a silverhilted sword hanging at his side he was a finelooking man a fitting companion for the elegant woman who crossed to a third idol this one a seated goddess with four sets of arms the woman touched her joined hands to her forehead bowed low then reached forward and rang a tiny handbell to attract the goddesss attention it was only then that sharpe recognized her mary he called and she turned in alarm to see sharpe standing in the deep shadows at the side of the shrine the look of terror on marys face checked sharpe the tall young soldier had put a hand on the hilt of his sword mary sharpe called again lass brother mary called aloud and then almost in a panic she repeated the word brother sharpe grinned disguising his confusion then he saw there were tears in marys eyes and he frowned are you all right lass tm very well she said deliberately and then in an even more stilted voice brother sharpe glanced at the indian soldier and saw that the man had a fiercely protective look is that the general he asked mary no its kunwar singh mary said and she turned and gestured towards the soldier and sharpe saw a look of tenderness on her face and all at once he understood what was happening does he speak english sharpe asked and then with a grin sister mary threw him a look of pure relief some she said how are you hows your back mending all right it is that indian doctor does magic he does i still feel it now and then but not like it was no im doing all right i even won a medal look he held the gold towards mary but i need to talk to you privately he added as she leaned close to peer at the medallion its urgent love he hissed mary fingered the gold then looked up at sharpe tm sorry richard she whispered theres nothing to be sorry for lass sharpe said and he spoke truthfully for ever since he had seen mary in her sari he had sensed that she was not for him she looked too sophisticated too elegant and the wives of common soldiers were usually neither you and him eh he asked glancing at the lean and handsome kunwar singh mary gave a tiny nod good for you sharpe called to the indian and gave him a smile good girl my sister halfsister mary hissed make up your bloody mind lass and ive taken an indian name she said aruna sounds good aruna sharpe smiled i like it it was my mothers name mary explained then fell into an awkward silence she glanced at the man with the white stripe on his head then tentatively touched sharpes elbow and so led him back into the shaded niche where he had been waiting a ledge ran round the niche and mary sat on it facing sharpe with her hands held modestly on her lap kunwar singh watched them but did not try to come close for a second neither sharpe nor mary had anything to say ive been watching that naked fellow sharpe said and he aint moved an inch its one way to worship mary said sofdy bloody odd though the whole things odd sharpe gestured around the decorated shrine looks like a circus dont it cant imagine it at home painted clowns in church eh can you imagine that then he remembered mary had never seen england it aint the same he said weakly then jerked his head towards the ever watchful kunwar singh you and him eh sharpe said again mary nodded tm sorry richard truly it happens lass sharpe said but you dont want him to know about you and me is that it she nodded and again looked fearful please she begged him sharpe paused not to keep mary on tenterhooks but because the naked man had at last moved he had slowly clasped his hands together but that seemed the extent of his exertions for he went quite still again richard mary pleaded you wont tell him will you he looked back to her i want you to do something for me he said she looked wary but nodded of course if i can theres a fellow in this city called ravi shekhar got the name hes a merchant god knows what he sells but hes here right enough and youve got to find him do they ever let you out of the house yes then you get out lass and find this ravi shekhar and tell him to get a message to the british and the message is this they mustnt attack the west wall thats it just that the daft buggers are setting themselves to attack it right now so its urgent will you do that mary licked her lips then nodded and you wont tell kunwar about us i wouldnt have told him anyway sharpe said of course i wouldnt i wish you joy of the fellow sister eh he smiled sister aruna its nice to have some family and youre all ive got and i hate to ask you to find this shekhar fellow but the lieutenant and me we just cant manage to escape so someone else has to send the message out looks like you sharpe grinned but it looks like youve changed sides now and i dont blame you so you dont mind doing this for me ill do it for you i promise youre a good lass he stood do brothers kiss sisters in india mary half smiled t think they do yes sharpe gave her a very respectable kiss on the cheek smelling her perfume you look grand mary he said too grand for me eh youre a good man richard that wont get me very far in this world will it he backed away from mary then grinned at kunwar singh who offered him a stiff slight bow youre a lucky man sharpe said and then with a backwards glance at the tall elegant woman who now called herself aruna he walked away from mary bickerstaff easy come easy go he thought but there was also a pang of jealousy for the tall goodlooking indian but what the hell mary was doing her best to survive and sharpe could never blame someone for doing that he was doing the same himself he had turned back towards the barracks where gudins battalion was quartered he was thinking about mary and about how graceful even unapproachable she had looked and he was hardly looking where he was going when a cheerful shout warned him of an approaching bullock cart that was loaded with great barrels sharpe stepped hastily aside as the bullocks their horns painted yellow and blue and tipped with small silver bells lumbered past he saw that the brightly painted cart was heading down a narrow alley which led towards the gatehouse in the western wall and the sentries at the gate seeing the cart approach heaved back the huge double doors and sharpe instinctively knew something was amiss he stood watching and suspected he was on the edge of solving the citys mystery the guards were opening the gates yet so far as sharpe knew there were no gates in the citys western wall which faced the south gauvery river he knew of the bangalore gate to the east the mysore gate to the south and the much smaller water gate to the north but no one had ever spoken of a fourth gate yet there it was once plainly there had been another water gate here a gate that opened onto the south gauvery and presumably that entrance to the city had long ago been sealed up yet now sharpe was watching the gates being opened and he impulsively turned and followed the cart down the alley the cart had already vanished into the deep gloom inside the gates tunnel and the two guards were dragging the big double doors closed but then they saw the bright gold medallion on sharpes chest and maybe that rare token convinced them that he had the authority to enter looking for colonel gudin sharpe offered in brazen explanation when one of the two men nervously moved to intercept him got a message for the colonel see then he was through the gate and he saw that it was not a passage out of the city at all but was rather a long tunnel that led only to a blank stone wall it had once been a gateway that much was obvious but at some time the old outer gate had been walled shut to leave this gloomy tunnel that was now stacked with barrels they had to be powder barrels for sharpe could see pale lengths of fuses coming from their stoppered bungholes the whole northern side of the tunnel was crammed with the powder barrels just the northern side an officer saw him and shouted angrily sharpe played the innocent colonel gudin he asked have you seen colonel gudin sahib the indian officer ran towards him and as he came he drew a pistol but then in the tunnels dim dusty light he saw the gold medal on sharpes chest and he pushed the pistol back into his sash gudin he asked sharpe sharpe smiled eagerly hes my officer sahib ive got a message for him the indian did not understand but he did know the significance of the medal and it was enough to make him respectful but he was still firm he pointed sharpe towards the door and gestured that he was to leave gudin sharpe insisted the man shook his head and sharpe with a grin left the tunnel he had forgotten mary now for he knew he was on the verge of understanding what was being kept so secret he went back down the alley and at its end he turned and looked at the wall above and he wondered why there were no gunners standing by the brass guns and why no sentries stood in the embrasures and why no flags were hung on the battlements everywhere else on the walls there were flags and sentries and gunners but not here he waited until the tunnel gates had been closed then he hurried up the nearby ramp that led to the walls firestep the wall here was made of red mud bricks and was not nearly so formidable as the southern wall which was constructed from massive granite blocks nor was this wall more than twenty feet thick whereas the tunnel had been nearer a hundred feet long he ran up to the parapet where the big guns waited and when he reached the firestep he understood everythingor there was not one wall here but two the one he was standing on was the inner wall and it was new so new that some short stretches of the wall were still festooned with scaffolding and ropes where the tippoos labourers hastened to complete the work and sixty feet away beyond an empty inner ditch was the citys outer wall where the flags were hung and where the gunners and sentries stood guard that old outer wall was a couple of feet higher than this new inner wall but opposite sharpe and close to where he had seen the powdercrammed tunnel those older ramparts had crumbled at their top that decay would surely serve as a beacon to the british enticing them to aim their guns at that stretch of decayed wall in the certainty that they could soon finish its destruction with their bombardment the big eighteen and twentyfourpounder guns would hammer away until the older outer wall collapsed to leave a ramplike breach the british staring across the river at that breach would doubtless see the new inner wall but they might well think it was nothing but the hank of a warehouse or a temple and so the assault would come storming across the shallow river and up the ramp of the breach in the outer wall and then spill down into the space between the two walls more and more men would come those behind forcing the ones in front ever onward and slowly the crush between the walls would grow the guns and rockets on the inner wall would rain down death but after a while when the attackers filled the space between the walls the huge charge of powder stored in what remained of the old elaborate gateway would be detonated and that explosion its force funnelled by the old and new walls would tear into the narrow gap and flood the ditch between the walls with blood sharpe looked to his left and saw that the tunnel was built beneath a squat gate tower that ancient tower would surely collapse spilling stones onto any troops who might survive the terrible blast bloody hell sharpe said and then he slipped back down the inner walls ramp and went to find lawford if mary did not get the news out he thought there would be slaughter when the assault came it would be pure slaughter and it seemed that only mary who was now in love with the enemy could prevent it chapter the siege works advanced steadily hampered only by the tippoos guns and by a shortage of the heavy timber needed to shore up the trenches and construct the batteries where the big siege guns would be emplaced colonel gent an engineer of the east india company supervised the work and he agreed wholeheartedly with general harris that the decayed stretch of the citys western walls was the obvious and opportune target then just days after the construction of the siege works had begun a local farmer revealed the existence of a new second wall behind the first the man insisted the new wall was unfinished but harris was worried enough by the farmers news to call his deputies to his tent where colonel gent delivered the gloomy intelligence about the new inner ramparts the fellow says his sons were taken away to help build the walls the engineer reported and he seems to be telling the truth baird broke the brief silence that followed gents words they cant surely garrison both walls the scotsman insisted the tippoo has no shortage of men wellesley pointed out thirty or forty thousand we hear more than enough to defend both walls i should think baird ignored the young colonel while harris uncomfortably aware of the bad feeling between his two deputies stared fixedly at his map of the city in the hope that some new inspiration would strike colonel gent sat beside harris the engineer unfolded a pair of wireframed spectacles and hooked them over his ears as he peered down at the map harris sighed i still think it has to be the west he said despite this new wall the north wellesley asked according to our farmer fellow gent answered the new inner wall goes all the way round the north he picked up a pencil and sketched the line of the new inner wall on the map to show that wherever the river flowed close to the city there was now a double rampart and the west is infinitely preferable to the north gent added the south cauverys shallow while the main river can still be treacherous at this time of year if our fellows have to wade through the cauvery let them do it here he tapped the citys western approach of course he added optimistically maybe that fellow was right and maybe that inner wall aint finished harris wished to god that mccandless was still with the army that subtle scotsman would have despatched a dozen disguised sepoys and discovered within hours the exact state of the new inner wall but mccandless was lost and so harris suspected were the two men sent to rescue him we could cross the arrakerry ford baird suggested then blast our way in from the east like cornwallis did harris lifted the hem of his wig and scratched at his old scalp wound we discussed all this before he said wearily he offered baird a wan smile to take the sting from his mild reproof then explained his reasons for not assaulting from the east first we have to force the crossing and the enemy has the river banks entrenched then we must get through the new wall around their encampment he touched the map showing where the tippoo had constructed a stout mud wall well served with guns that surrounded the encampment which lay outside the citys southern and eastern walls and after that we have to lay siege to the city proper and we know that both the east and south ramparts already have inner walls and to breach those walls every round shot and pound of powder will have to be carried across the river and one good rainfall will make the ford impassable gent put in gloomily not to mention bringing those damned crocodiles back he shook his head i wouldnt want to be carrying three tons of supplies a day across a halfflooded river full of hungry teeth so wherever we attack wellesley asked we have to pierce two walls thats what the man said baird growled this new inner wall wellesley asked gent ignoring baird what do we know of it mud gent said red mud bricks just like devon mud mud will crumble wellesley pointed out if its dry it will gent agreed but the core of the wall wont be dry thoroughly good stuff mud soaks up the cannon fire ive seen twentyfourpounder shots bounce off mud like currants off a suet pudding give me a good stone wall to break down any day break its crust and the guns turn the rubble core into a staircase but not mud gent stared at the map picking his teeth with the sharpened nib of a quill not mud he added in a gloomy undertone but it will yield harris asked anxiously oh itll yield sir itll yield i can warrant you that but how much time do we have to persuade it to yield the engineer peered over his spectacles at the bewigged general the monsoon aint so far off and once the rains begin we might as well go home for all the good well ever do you want a path through both walls itll take two weeks more and even then the inner breach will be perilously narrow perilously narrow cant enfilade it you see and the breach in the outer wall will serve as a glacis to protect the base of the inner wall straight on fire sir and all aimed a deal higher than any respectable gunner would want we can make you a breach of sorts but itll be narrow and high and god only knows whatll be waiting on the other side nothing good i dare say but we can breach this outer wall quickly enough harris asked tapping the place on his map aye sir its mostly mud again but its older so the centre will be drier once we break through the crust the thing should fall apart in hours harris stared down at the map unconsciously scratching beneath his wig ladders he said after a long pause baird looked alarmed youre not thinking of an escalade god save us weve no timber gent protested bamboo scaling ladders harris said just a few he smiled as he leaned back in his chair make me a breach colonel gent and forget the inner wall well assault the breach but we wont go through it instead well attack the shoulders of the breach well use ladders to climb off the breach onto the walls then attack round the ramparts once those outer walls are ours the beggars will have to surrender there was silence in the tent as the diree officers considered harriss suggestion colonel gent tried to clean his spectacle lenses with a corner of his sash youd better pray our fellows get up on the walls damned fast sir gent broke the silence youll be sending whole battalions across the river general and the lads behind will be pushing the fellows in front and if theres any delay theyll spill into the space between the walls like water seeking its level and god knows whats in between those walls a flooded ditch mines but even if theres nothing there the poor fellows will still be trapped between two fires two forlorn hopes harris said thinking aloud and ignoring gents gloomy comments instead of one they both attack two or three minutes ahead of the main assault their orders will be to climb off the breach and onto the walls one hope turns north along the outer ramparts the other south that way they dont need to go between the walls itll be a desperate business gent said flatly assaults always are baird said stoutly thats why we employ forlorn hopes the forlorn hope was the small band of volunteers who went first into a breach to trigger the enemys surprises casualties were invariably heavy though there was never a shortage of volunteers this time though it did promise to be desperate for the two forlorn hopes were not being asked to fight through the breach but rather to turn towards the walls either side of the breach and fight their way up onto the ramparts you cant take a city without shedding blood baird went on then stiffened in his chair and once again sir i request permission to lead the main assault harris smiled granted david he spoke gently using bairds christian name for the first time and god be with you god be with the damned tippoo baird said hiding his delight hes the one wholl need the help i thank you sir you do me honour or i send you to your death harris thought but kept the sentiment silent he rolled up the city map speed gentlemen he said speed the rains will come soon enough so lets get this business done the troops went on digging zigzagging their way across the fertile fields between the aqueduct and the south branch of the cauvery a second british army six and a half thousand men from cannanore on indias western malabar coast arrived to swell the besiegers ranks the newcomers camped north of the cauvery and placed gun batteries that could sweep the approach to the proposed breach so that the city with its thirty thousand defenders was now besieged by fiftyseven thousand men half of whom marched under british colours and half under the banners of hyderabad six thousand of the british troops were actually british the rest were sepoys and behind all the troops in the sprawling encampments more than a hundred thousand hungry civilians waited to plunder the supplies rumoured to be inside seringapatam harris had men enough for the siege and assault but not enough to ring the city entirely and so the tippoos cavalry made daily sallies from the unguarded eastern side of the island to attack the foraging parties who ranged deep into the country in search of timber and food the nizam of hyderabads horsemen fought off the daily attacks the nizam was a muslim but he had no love for his coreligionist the tippoo and the men of hyderabads army fought fiercely one horseman came back to the camp with the heads of six enemies tied by their long hair to his lance he held the bloody trophies aloft and galloped proudly along the tent lines to the cheers of the sepoys and redcoats harris sent the man a purse of guineas while meer allum the commander of the nizams forces more practically ordered a concubine to express his gratitude the trenches made ground daily but one last formidable obstacle prevented their approach close enough to the city for the siege guns to begin their destructive work on the southern bank of the cauvery a halfmile west of the city stood the ruins of an old watermill built of stone the ancient walls were thick enough to withstand the artillery fire from harriss camp and from the new british positions across the river the ruined buildings had been converted into a stout fort that was equipped with a deep defensive ditch and was strongly garrisoned by two of the tippoos finest cushoons reinforced by cannon and rocketmen and so long as the mill fort existed no british gun could be dragged within battering range of the citys walls the two flags that flew over the mill fort were shot away every day but each dawn the flags would be hoisted again albeit on shorter staffs and once again the british and indian gunners would blaze away with round shot and shell and once again the sun flag and the banner of the lion of god would be felled but whenever skirmishers went close to the fort to discover if any defender survived there would be a blast of cannon rockets and musketry to prove that the tippoos men were still dangerous the tippoo could even reinforce the garrison thanks to a deep trench that ran close to the south branch of the cauvery and up which his men could creep through the night to relieve the forts battered garrison the fort had to be taken harris ordered a dusk attack that was led by indian and scottish flank companies supported by a party of engineers whose job was to bridge the mills deep ditch for an hour before the assault the artillery on both banks of the river rained shells into the mill the twelvepounder guns were loaded with howitzer shells and the wispy trails of their burning fuses sputtered across the darkening sky to plunge into the smoke which churned up from the battered fort to the waiting infantry who would have to wade through the little cauvery cross the ditch and assault the mill it seemed as if the small fort was being obliterated for there was nothing to be seen but the boiling smoke and dust amongst which the shells exploded with dull red flashes but every few moments as if to belie the destruction that seemed so complete an indian gun would flash back its response and a round shot would scream across the fields towards the british batteries or else a rocket would flare up from the defenders and snake its thicker smoke trail across the delicate tracery left by the fuses of the howitzer shells the largest guns on the city wall were also firing trying to bounce their shot up from the ground so that the ricochets would reach the besiegers artillery sharpe inside the city heard the vast hammering of the guns and wondered if it presaged an assault on the citys walls but sergeant rothiere assured the men that it was only the british wasting ammunition on the old mill the bombardment suddenly ceased and the tippoos men came scrambling out of the mills damp cellars to take their places at their firescorched ramparts they reached their broken firesteps just in time for the leading engineers were already hurling lit carcasses into the ditch the carcasses were bundles of damp straw tight wrapped about a papercased shell of saltpetre corned gunpowder and antimony the carcasses burned fiercely consuming the straw from the inside to billow choking streams of smoke through vents left in the casings so that within seconds the ditch was filled with a dense fog of grey smoke into which the frightened defenders poured a badly aimed musket volley more carcasses were hurled adding to the blinding smoke and under this cover a dozen planks were thrown across the ditch and screaming attackers charged across with fixed bayonets only a few of the tippoos men still had loaded muskets those men fired and one of the attackers fell through the smoke to fall on the hissing carcasses but the rest were already scrambling over the walls half the attackers were macleods highlanders from perthshire the others were bengali infantry and both came into the mill like avenging furies the tippoos men seemed stunned by the suddenness of the assault or else they had been so shaken by the shelling and were so confused by the choking smoke that they were incapable of resistance and incapable too of surrender bengalis and highlanders hunted through the ruins their war cries shrill as they bayoneted and shot the garrison while behind them before the smoke of the carcasses had even begun to fade or the fighting in the mill die down the engineers were constructing a stouter bridge across which they could haul their siege guns so they could turn the old mill into a breaching battery the smoke of the carcasses at last died and drifted away its remnants touched red by the setting sun and in the lurid light a highlander capered on the ramparts with the captured sun banner at the end of his bayonet while a bengali havildar waved the tippoos lion flag in celebration the assault had turned into a massacre and the officers now tried to calm the attackers down as they pierced ever deeper into the mills vaults the innermost cellar was grimly defended by a group of the tippoos infantry but an engineer brought the last remaining carcass into the mill lit its fuse waited until the smoke began to pour from the vents and then hurled it down the steps there were a few seconds of silence then dazed and gasping defenders came scrambling up the steep stairs the mill fort was taken and astonishingly only one of the attackers had been killed but a shocked highlander lieutenant counted two hundred dead bodies dressed in the tippoos tigerstriped tunic and still more enemy dead were piled bloodily in every embrasure the rest of the garrison was either taken prisoner or else had managed to flee down the connecting trench to the city a scottish sergeant finding one of the tippoos rockets in a magazine stuck it vertically between two of the ruins bigger stones then lit the fuse there were cheers as the rocket flamed and smoked then louder cheers as it screamed up into the sky it began to corkscrew leaving a crazy trail of smoke in the twilight air and then reaching its apogee and by now almost invisible it tumbled and fell into the cauvery next morning the first eighteenpounders were already emplaced in the mill the range to the city was long but not impossible and harris gave the order for the guns to open fire the eighteenpounder cannon were among the heavy siege guns that would make the breach but for now they were employed to batter the enemys own guns seringapatams outer wall was protected by a glacis but there was not enough distance between the river and the wall to construct a full glacis with a gently sloping outer face high enough to bounce cannon shot over the citys walls and so the low glacis could only protect the walls base not the parapet and the eighteenpounders first shots were aimed to scour that parapet of its guns the good fortune that had accompanied the bengalis and the highlanders in their assault on the old mill now seemed to settle on the shoulders of the gunners for their very first shot cracked apart an embrasure and the second dismounted the gun behind it and after that every shot seemed to have an equally destructive effect british and indian officers watched through spyglasses as embrasure after embrasure was destroyed and as gun after gun was thrown down a dozen heavy cannon were tumbled forward into the flooded ditch between the city wall and the glacis and every tumbling fall was greeted by a cheer from the besiegers the citys western wall was being stripped of guns and the artillerymens prowess seemed to promise an easy assault spirits in the allied ranks soared while inside the city watching his precious cannon being destroyed the tippoo fumed the mill fort on which he had pinned such high hopes of delaying the enemy till the monsoon washed them away had fallen like a childs wooden toy and now his precious guns were being obliterated it was time the tippoo decided to show his soldiers that these redcoated enemies were not invulnerable demons but mortal men and that like any other mortal men they could be made to whimper it was time to unsheath the tigers claws a halfhours walk east of the city just outside the embrasured wall that protected the tippoos encampment lay his summer palace the daria dowlat it was much smaller than the inner palace within the city for the inner palace was where the tippoos enormous harem lived and where his government had its offices and his army its headquarters and so it was a sprawl of stables storehouses courtyards state rooms and prison cells the inner palace seethed with activity a place where hundreds of folk had their daily living while the summer palace set in its wide green gardens and protected by a thick hedge of aloe was a haven of peace the daria dowlat had not been built to impress but rather for comfort only two storeys high the building was made from huge teak beams over which stucco had been laid then modelled and painted so that every surface glittered in the sunlight the whole palace was surrounded by a twostoreyed verandah and on the western outer wall under the verandah where the sun could not fade it the tippoo had ordered painted a vast mural showing the battle of pollilur at which seventeen years before he had destroyed a british army that great victory had extended mysores dominion along the malabar coast and in honour of the triumph the palace had been built and received its name the daria dowlat or treasure of the sea the palace lay on the road leading to the islands eastern tip the same road on which was built the fine elegant mausoleum in which the tippoos great father hyder ali and his mother the begum fatima were buried there too one day the tippoo prayed he would lie at rest the daria dowlats garden was a wide lawn dotted with pools trees shrubs and flowers roses grew there and mangoes but there were also exotic strains of indigo and cotton mixed with pineapples from africa and avocados from mexico all of them plants that the tippoo had encouraged or imported in the hope that they would prove profitable for his country but on this day the day after the mill fort had been swamped with smoke fire and blood the garden was filled with two thousand of the tippoos thirty thousand troops the men paraded in three sides of a hollow square to the north of the palace leaving the daria dowlats shadowed facade as the fourth side of their square the tippoo had ordered entertainment for his troops there were dancers from the city two jugglers and a man who charmed snakes but best of all the tippoos wooden tiger organ had been fetched from the inner palace and the soldiers laughed as the lifesize model tiger raked its claws across the redcoats bloodpainted face the bellowdriven growl did not carry very far any more than did the pathetic cry of the tigers victim but the action of the toy alone was sufficient to amuse the men the tippoo arrived in a palanquin just after midday none of his european advisers accompanied him nor were any of his european troops present though appah rao was in attendance for two of the five cushoons parading in the palace gardens came from raos brigade and the hindu general stood tall and silent just behind the tippoo on the palaces upper verandah appah rao disapproved of what was about to happen but he dared not make a protest for any sign of disloyalty from a hindu was enough to rouse the tippoos suspicions besides the tippoo could not be dissuaded his astrologers had told him that a period of ill luck had arrived and that it could only be averted by sacrifice other sages had peered into the smokemisted surface of a pot of hot oil the tippoos favourite form of divination and had deciphered the strangecoloured and slowmoving swirls to declare that they told the same grim tale a season of bad fortune had come to seringapatam that bad luck had caused both the fall of the mill fort and the destruction of the guns on the outer western wall and the tippoo was determined to avert this sudden ill fortune the tippoo let his soldiers enjoy the tiger for a few moments longer then he clapped his hands and ordered his servants to carry the model back to the inner palace the tigers place was taken by a dozen jettis who strode onto the forecourt with their bare torsos gleaming for a few moments they amused the soldiers with their more commonplace tricks they bent iron rods into circles lifted grown men on both hands or juggled with cannonballs then a goatskin drum sounded and the jettis obedient to its strokes went back to the shadows under the tippoos balcony the watching soldiers fell into an expectant silence then growled as a sorry party of prisoners was herded onto the forecourt there were thirteen prisoners all in red coats all of them men of the rd who had been captured during the night battle at the sultanpetah tope the thirteen men stood uncertainly amidst the ring of their enemies the sun beat down one of the prisoners a sergeant twitched as he stared at the ranks of tigerstriped soldiers and still his face twitched as he turned around and gazed with a curious intensity when the tippoo stepped to the rail of the upper verandah and in a clear high voice spoke to his troops the enemy the tippoo said had been fortunate they had gained some cheap victories to the west of the city but that was no reason to fear them the british sorcerers knowing they could not defeat the tigers of mysore by force alone had made a powerful spell but with the help of allah that spell would now be confounded the soldiers greeted the speech with a long and approving sigh while the prisoners unable to understand any of the tippoos words looked anxiously about but could make no sense of the occasion guards surrounded the prisoners and pushed them back to the palace leaving just one man alone on the forecourt that man tried to go with his companions but a guard thrust him back with a bayonet and the uneven contest between a confused prisoner and an armed guard sparked a gust of laughter the prisoner driven back to the centre of the forecourt waited nervously two jettis walked towards him they were big men formidably bearded tall and with their long hair bound and tied about their heads the prisoner licked his lips the jettis smiled and suddenly the redcoat sensed his fate and took two or three hurried steps away from the strongmen the watching soldiers laughed as the redcoat tried to escape but he was penned in by three walls of tigerstriped infantry and there was nowhere to run he tried to dodge past the twojettis but one of them reached out and snatched a handful of his red coat the prisoner beat at the jetti with his fists but it was like a rabbit cuffing at a wolf the watching soldiers laughed again though there was a nervousness in their amusement the jetti drew the soldier in to his body then hugged him in a terrible last embrace the second jetti took hold of the redcoats head paused to take breath then twisted the prisoners dying scream was choked off in an instant for a second his head stared sightlessly backwards then the jettis released him and as the twisted neck grotesquely righted itself the man collapsed one of the jettis picked up the corpse in one huge hand and contemptuously tossed it high into the air like a terrier tossing a dead rat the watching soldiers were silent for a second then cheered the tippoo smiled a second redcoat was driven to the jettis and this man was forced to kneel he did not move as the nail was placed on his head he uttered one curse then died in seconds as his blood spurted out onto the gravel forecourt a third man was killed with a single punch to his chest a blow so massive that it drove him back a full twelve paces before shuddering his ruptured heart gave up the watching soldiers shouted that they wanted to see another mans neck wrung like a chicken and the jettis obliged and so one by one the prisoners were forced to their killers three of the men died abjectly calling for mercy and weeping like babes two died saying prayers but the rest died defiantly three put up a fight and one tall grenadier raised an ironic cheer from the watching troops by breaking a jettis finger but then he too died like the rest one after the other they died and those who came last were forced to watch their comrades deaths and to wonder how they would be sent to meet their maker whether they would be spiked through the skull or have their necks twisted north to south or simply be beaten to bloody death and all of the prisoners once dead were decapitated by a sword blow before the two parts of their bodies were wrapped in reed mats and laid aside the jettis saved the sergeant till last the watching soldiers were in a fine mood now they had been nervous at first apprehensive of coldblooded death on a sundrenched afternoon but the strength of the jettis and the desperate antics of the doomed men trying to escape had amused them and now they wanted to enjoy this last victim who promised to provide the finest entertainment of the day his face was twitching in what the spectators took to be uncontrollable fear but despite that terror he proved astonishingly agile forever scuttling out of the jettis way and shouting up towards the tippoo again and again he would appear to be cornered but somehow he would always slide or twist or duck his way free and with his face shuddering would call desperately to the tippoo his shouts were drowned by the cheers of the soldiers who applauded every narrow escape two more jettis came to help catch the elusive man and though he tried to twist past them they at last had the sergeant trapped the jettis advanced in a line forcing him back towards the palace and the watching soldiers fell silent in expectation of his death the sergeant feinted to his left then suddenly twisted and ran from the advancing jettis towards the palace the guards moved to drive him back towards his executioners but the man stopped beneath the verandah and stared up at the tippoo i know who the traitors are here he shouted in the silence i know a jetti caught the sergeant from behind and forced him to his knees get these black bastards off me the sergeant screamed listen your honour i know whats going on here theres a british officer in the city wearing your uniform for gods sake mother this last cry was torn from obadiah hakeswill as a second jetti placed his hands on the sergeants head hakeswill wrenched his face round and bit down hard on the ball of the jettfs thumb and the astonished man jerked his hands away leaving a scrap of flesh in the sergeants mouth hakeswill spat the morsel out listen your grace i know what the bastards are up to traitors on my oath get away from me you heathen black bastard i cant die i cant die mother the jetti with the bitten hand had gripped the sergeants head and begun to turn it usually the neck was wrung swiftly for a huge explosion of energy was needed to break a mans spine but this time the jetti planned a slow and exquisitely painful death in revenge for his bitten hand mother hakeswill screamed as his face was forced farther around and then just as it was twisted back past his shoulder he made one last effort i saw a british officer in the city no wait the tippoo called the jetti paused still holding hakeswills head at an unnatural angle what did he say the tippoo asked one of his officers who spoke some english and who had been translating the sergeants desperate words the officer translated again the tippoo waved one of his small delicate hands and the aggrieved jetti let go of hakeswills head the sergeant cursed as the agonizing tension left his neck then rubbed at the pain bleeding heathen bastard he said you murdering black bugger he spat at the jetti shook himself out of the grip of the man holding him then stood and walked two paces towards the palace i saw him didnt i with my own eyes in a frock like them he gestured at the watching soldiers in their tigerstriped tunics a lieutenant he is and the army says he went back to madras but he didnt did he cos hes here cos i saw him me obadiah hakeswill your highness and keep that bleeding heathen darkie away from me one of the jettis had come close and hakeswill his face twitching turned on the looming man go on bugger off back to your sty you bloody great lump the officer who spoke english called down from the verandah who did you see he asked i told you your honour didnt i no you didnt give us a name hakeswills face twitched iil tell you he wheedled if you promise to let me live he dropped to his knees and stared up at the verandah i dont mind being in your dungeons my lord for obadiah hakeswill never did mind a rat or two but i dont want these bleeding heathens screwing me neck back to front it aint a christian act the officer translated for the tippoo who at last nodded and so prompted the officer to turn back to hakeswill you will live he called down word of honour hakeswill asked upon my honour cross your heart and hope to die like it says in the scriptures you will live the officer snapped so long as you tell us the truth i always do that sir honest hakeswill thats my name sir i sawhim didnt i lieutenant lawford william hes called tall lanky fellow with fair hair and blue eyes and he aint alone private bleeding sharpe was with him the officer had not understood everything that hakeswill had said but he had understood enough you are saying this man lawford is a british officer he asked course he is in my bleeding company whats more and they said hed gone back to madras on account of carrying despatches but he never did cos there werent no despatches to be carried hes here your grace and up to no bleeding good and like i said dolled up in a stripy frock the officer seemed sceptical the only englishmen we have here sergeant are prisoners or deserters youre lying hakeswill spat on the gravel that was soaked with the blood from the decapitated prisoners how can he be a deserter officers dont desert they sell their commissions and bugger off home to mummy i tell you sir hes an officer and the other ones a right bastard flogged he was and quite right too he should have been flogged to bleeding death only the general sent for him the mention of the flogging woke a memory in the tippoo when was he flogged the officer translated the tippoos question just before he ran sir raw he must have been but not raw enough and you say the general sent for him the officer sounded disbelieving harris sir the bugger what lost a lump out of his skull in america he sent our colonel he did and colonel wellesley stopped the flogging stopped it hakeswills indignation was still keen stopping a flogging whats been properly ordered never seen anything so disgraceful in all me born days going to the dogs the army is going to the dogs the tippoo listened to the translation then stepped back from the railing he turned to appah rao who had once served in the east india companys army do british officers desert none that ive ever heard of your majesty appah rao said glad that the shadows of the balcony were hiding his pale and worried face they might resign and sell their commission but desert never the tippoo nodded down to the kneeling hakeswill put that wretch back in the cells he ordered and tell colonel gudin to meet me at the inner palace guards dragged hakeswill back to the city and he had a bib hi with him hakeswill shouted as he was pulled away but no one took any notice the sergeant was shedding tears of pure happiness as he was taken back through the bangalore gate thank you mother he called to the cloudless sky thank you mother for i cannot die the twelve dead men were hidden in a makeshift grave the troops marched back to their encampment while the tippoo being carried to the inner palace beneath the tigerstriped canopy of his palanquin reflected that the sacrifice of the twelve prisoners had not been in vain for it had revealed the presence of enemies allah be thanked he reflected for his luck had surely turned you think mrs bickerstaff has gone over to the enemy lawford asked sharpe for the third or fourth time shes gone to his bed sharpe said bleakly but i reckon shell still help us sharpe had washed both his and lawfords tunics and now he patted the cloth to see if it had dried looking after kit in this army he reflected was a deal easier than in the british there was no pipeclay here to be caked onto crossbelts and musket slings no blackball to be used on boots and no grease and powder to be slathered on the hair he decided the tunics were dry enough and tossed one to the lieutenant then pulled his own over his head carefully freeing the gold medallion so that it hung on his chest his tunic also boasted a red cord on his left shoulder the tippoos insignia of a corporal lawford seemed to resent sharpe bearing these marks of rank that were denied to him suppose she betrays us lawford asked then were in trouble sharpe said brutally but she wont marys a good lass lawford shrugged she jilted you easy come easy go sharpe said then belted the tunic like most of the tippoos soldiers he now went barelegged beneath the kneelength garment though lawford insisted on keeping his old british trousers both men wore their old shakos though george his badge had been replaced by a tin tiger with an upraised paw listen sharpe said to a still worried lawford ive done what you asked and the lass says shell find this ravi whatever his name is and all we have to do now is wait and if we get a chance to run we run like buggery you reckon that muskets ready for inspection its clean lawford said defensively hefting his big french firelock christ youd be on a charge for that musket back in the proper army give it here sergeant rothieres daily inspection was not for another halfhour and after that the two men would be free until mid afternoon when it would be the turn of gudins battalion to stand guard over the mysore gate that guard duty ended at midnight but sharpe knew there would be no chance of an escape for the mysore gate did not offer an exit from the tippoos territory but rather led into the citys surrounding encampment which in turn had a strong perimeter guard the previous night sharpe had experimented to see whether his red cord and gold medallion would be authority enough for him to wander through the encampment maybe allowing him to find a shadowed and quiet stretch of its earthworks over which he could scramble in the dark but he had been intercepted within twenty yards of the gate and politely but firmly ushered back the tippoo it seemed was taking no chances i already had wazzy clean that lawford said nodding at the musket in sharpes hands wazir was one of the small boys who hung around the barracks to earn pice for washing and cleaning equipment i paid him lawford said indignantly if you want a job done properly sharpe said you do it yourself hell he swore because he had pinched his finger on the muskets mainspring which he had uncovered by unscrewing the lock plate look at that rust he managed to unseat the mainspring without losing the trigger mechanism then began to file the rust off the springs edge bloody rubbish these french muskets he grumbled nothing like a proper birmingham bundook do you clean your own musket like that lawford asked impressed that sharpe had unscrewed the lock plate course i do not that hakeswill ever cares he only looks at the outside sharpe grinned you remember that day you saved my skin with the flint hakeswill had changed it for a bit of stone but i caught it before he could do any damage hes a fly bastard that one he changed it lawford seemed shocked bloody snake that obadiah how much did you pay wazzy an anna he robbed you you want to pass me that oil bottle lawford obliged then settled back against the stone water trough in which sharpe had washed the tunics he felt strangely content despite the apparent failure of his mission there was a pleasure in sharing this intimacy with sharpe indeed it felt oddly like a privilege many young officers were frightened of the men they commanded fearing their scorn and they concealed their apprehension with a display of careless arrogance lawford doubted he could ever do that now for he no longer felt any fear of the crude hard men who formed the ranks of britains army sharpe had cured him of that by teaching him that the crudity was unthinking and the hardness a disguise for conscientiousness not that every man was conscientious any more than all britains soldiers were crude but too many officers assumed they were all brutes and treated them as such now lawford watched as sharpes capable fingers forced the cleaned mainspring back into its cavity using his picklock as a lever lieutenant a voice called respectfully across the yard lieutenant lawford sir lawford responded without thinking turning towards the voice and rising to his feet then he realized what he had done and blanched sharpe swore colonel gudin walked slowly across the yard rubbing his long face as he approached the two englishmen lieutenant william lawford he enquired gently of his majestys rd regiment of foot lawford said nothing gudin shrugged officers are supposedly men of honour lieutenant are you going to continue to lie no sir lawford said gudin sighed so are you a commissioned officer or not i am sir lawford sounded ashamed though whether it was because he had been accused of dishonourable behaviour or because he had betrayed his true rank sharpe could not tell and you coporal sharpe gudin asked sadly i aint an officer colonel no gudin said t did not think you were but are you a true deserter of course i am sir sharpe lied gudin smiled at sharpes confident tone and you lieutenant he asked lawford are you truly a deserter lawford made no reply and gudin sighed answer me on your honour lieutenant if you would be so kind no sir lawford admitted nor is private sharpe sir gudin nodded that is what the sergeant said the sergeant sir lawford asked gudin grimaced i fear the tippoo executed the prisoners taken the other night he spared just one because that man told him of you the bastard sharpe said throwing the musket down in disgust bloody hakeswill he swore again far more viciously sir lawford said to gudin ignoring sharpes anger lieutenant gudin responded courteously we were captured by the tippoos men while wearing our red coats sir that means we should be protected as legitimate prisoners of war gudin shook his head it means nothing of the sort lieutenant for you lied about your rank and your intentions he sounded disapproving but i shall still plead for your lives gudin sat on the water troughs edge and flapped a hand at a persistent fly will you tell me why you came here no sir lawford said i suppose not but i warn you that the tippoo will want to know gudin smiled at sharpe i had come to the conclusion sharpe that you are one of the best soldiers i have ever had the pleasure to command but only one thing worried me about you and that was why a good soldier would desert from his allegiance even if he had been flogged but now i see you are a better man than i thought he frowned because sharpe while this elegant compliment was being paid had lifted the back of his tunic and seemed to be scratching his bottom sorry sir sharpe said noticing the colonels distaste and dropping his tunics hem tm sorry to be losing you sharpe gudin went on im afraid there is an escort waiting for you outside the barracks youre to be taken to the palace gudin paused but must have decided there was nothing he could add that might ameliorate the implied threat of his words instead he turned and snapped his fingers to bring a disapproving sergeant rothiere into the courtyard rothiere carried their red coats and sharpes white trousers they may help a little gudin said though without any real hope in his voice the colonel watched as they discarded their newly cleaned tunics and pulled on their red coats about your woman he said to sharpe then hesitated she had nothing to do with this sir sharpe said hurriedly as he pulled on the trousers he buttoned his old jacket and the red coat felt strangely confining after the looser tunic on my honour sir and besides he added she gave me the push twice unlucky sharpe bad in a soldier that gudin smiled and reached out a hand your muskets gentlemen if you please sharpe handed over both guns sir private sharpe sharpe reddened and became awkward it was an honour to serve you sir i mean that i wish we had more like you in our army thank you sharpe gudin gravely acknowledged the compliment of course he added if you tell me now that your experiences here have changed your loyalties and that you would truly like to continue serving the tippoo then you might be spared whatever is in store for you i think i could persuade his majesty of your change of heart but youd need to tell me why you came here in the first place lawford stiffened as this offer was made to sharpe sharpe hesitated then shook his head no sir he said i reckon im a proper redcoat gudin had expected the reply good for you sharpe and by the way private you might as well hang the medallion around your neck theyll find it anyway yes sir sharpe retrieved the gold from his trouser pocket where he had optimistically concealed it and looped the chain over his head gudin stood and gestured towards the barracks room this way gentlemen that was the end of the pleasantries and sharpe suspected it would be the last pleasantry for a very long time for now they were the tippoos prisoners appah rao had mary fetched to a room off the courtyard of his house kunwar singh was waiting there but mary was frightened and dared not look at kunwar singh for fear of seeing a hint of bad news on his handsome face mary had no particular reason to expect bad news but she was ever wary and something about appah raos stiff demeanour told her that her presentiments were justified your companions appah rao told her when the servant had closed the door behind her have been arrested lieutenant lawford and private sharpe the one you say is your brother my halfbrother sir mary whispered if you say so appah rao conceded kunwar singh spoke a little english though not enough to follow the conversation which was why appah rao had chosen to question mary in that language even though his mastery of it was uncertain appah rao doubted whether sharpe and mary were related but he liked the girl nevertheless and he approved of her as kunwar singhs bride the gods alone knew what the future would bring to mysore but it was likely that the british would be involved and if kunwar singh had a wife who spoke english there would be an advantage for him besides appah raos wife lakshmi was convinced that the girl was a good modest creature and that her past like the past of kunwar singhs family was best forgotten why did they come here the general asked i dont know sir appah rao took a pistol from his belt and began loading it both mary and kunwar singh watched with alarm as the general carefully measured powder from a silver horn into the pistols chased barrel aruna he said using the name mary had taken from her mother let me tell you what will happen to lieutenant lawford and private sharpe he paused to tap the horns spout against the pistols muzzle to shake loose the last specks of powder the tippoo will have them questioned and doubtless the questioning will be painful in the end aruna they will confess all men do maybe they will live maybe not i cannot tell he looked up at her then pushed a scrap of wadding into the pistol the tippoo he went on as he selected a bullet from the pistols wooden case will want to know two things first why they came here and second whether they were told to make contact with any person inside the city do you understand me yes sir the general placed the bullet in the barrel then pulled out the pistols short ramrod theyre going to tell him aruna however brave they are they will talk in the end of course he paused as he rammed the bullet hard down the tippoo might remember your existence and if he does aruna then he will send for you and you will be questioned too but not so gently as i am questioning you now no sir mary whispered appah rao slotted the short ramrod back in its hoops he primed the gun but did not cock it i want no harm to come to you aruna so tell me why the two men came to seringapatam mary stared at the pistol in the generals hand it was a beautiful weapon with a butt inlaid with ivory and a barrel chased with silver whorls then she looked up into the generals eyes and saw that he had no intention of shooting her she did not see threat in those eyes just fear and it was that fear which decided her to tell the truth they came sir she said because they had to reach a man called mccandless it was the answer rao had feared and did they no sir so what did they find out rao asked laying the pistol down on the table what did they find out he asked in a harder voice private sharpe told me that the british shouldnt attack in the west sir mary said forgetting to describe sharpe as her brother thats all he said honestly sir all rao asked surely not why would he tell you that did he think you could get the news out of the city mary stared down at the pistol t was to find a man sir she said at last who she looked up at the general fear in her eyes a merchant sir called ravi shekhar anyone else no sir truly rao believed her and felt a wash of relief his greatest fear was that sharpe and lawford might have been given his own name for although colonel mccandless had promised to keep raos treachery a secret rao could not be certain that the promise had been kept mccandless himself had not been questioned under torture for the tippoo seemed convinced that the elderly colonel ross had indeed been foraging when he had been captured but rao still felt the threat of discovery moving insidiously closer lawford and shaipe could not identify rao himself as a traitor but they very well might identify mccandless and then the tippoos jettis would turn their attentions to the elderly scotsman and how long would he endure their merciless treatment the general wondered if he should make a dash from the city to the british lines but rejected the thought almost as soon as it occurred to him such an escape might secure appah raos own safety but it would sacrifice his large family and all the faithful servants who were in his employment no he decided this dangerous game must be seen to its finish he pushed the pistol closer to mary take it he ordered her mary looked astonished the pistol sir take it now listen girl ravi shekhar is dead and his body was fed to the tigers its possible the tippoo will forget you even existed but if he remembers then you might need that pistol appah rao wondered if he could smuggle the girl clean out of the city it was a tempting thought but every civilian was stopped at the gates and had to produce a pass stamped by the tippoo himself and very few received that pass a soldier might succeed in escaping the city but not a civilian appah rao gazed into marys dark eyes i am told that placing it in your mouth and pointing it slightly upwards is the most effective mary shuddered and the general nodded to kunwar singh i give her to your care he said kunwar singh bowed his head mary went back to the womens quarters while appah rao made an offering at his household shrine he lingered there thinking how he envied the certainty of men like the tippoo or colonel mccandless neither man seemed to have any doubts but rather believed that destiny was whatever they themselves made of it they were not subject to other mens wills and appah rao would have liked such certainty for himself he would have liked to live in a mysore ruled by its ancient hindu house and a mysore in which no other nations intruded no british no french no mahrattas and no muslims but instead he found himself caught between two armies and somehow he had to keep his wife his children his servants and himself alive he closed his eyes touched his hands to his forehead and bowed to ganesh the elephantheaded god who guarded appah raos household just keep us alive he prayed to the god just keep us alive the tippoo himself came to the courtyard where the tigers had been restored to their long chains four infantrymen guarded the two englishmen the tippoo did not come in state with chamberlains and courtiers but was accompanied by only one officer and two jettis who watched impassively as the tippoo strode to sharpe and tugged the medallion from around his neck he pulled so hard that the chain cut into the back of sharpes neck before it snapped then the tippoo spat into sharpes face and turned away the officer was a suave young muslim who spoke good english his majesty he said when the tippoo turned back to face the prisoners wishes to know why you came to the city lawford stiffened i am an officer in his britannic majestys he began but the indian cut him off with a gesture quiet the officer said wearily you are nothing except what we make you so why are you here why do you think sharpe said the officer looked at him i think he said judiciously that you came here to spy so now you know sharpe said defiantly the officer smiled but maybe you were given the name of a man who might help you inside the city that is the name we want sharpe shook his head didnt give us any names not one maybe the officer said then nodded at the two jettis who seized hold of sharpe then ripped the coat down his back so that its buttons tore off one by one as it was dragged down he wore no shirt beneath only the bandages that still covered the wounds caused by his flogging one of the jettis drew a knife and unceremoniously sliced through the bandages making sharpe flinch as the blade cut into the almost healed wounds the bandages were tossed aside and the smell of them made one of the tigers stir the other jetti had crossed to the four soldiers where he had drawn out one of their muskets ramrods now he stood behind sharpe and when the tippoo nodded he gave sharpes back a vicious cut with the metal rod the sudden pain was every bit as bad as the flogging it stabbed up and down sharpes spine and he gasped with the effort not to scream aloud as the force of the blow threw him forwards he broke his fall with his hands and now his back faced the sky and the jetti slashed down three more times opening the old wounds cracking a rib and spurting blood onto the courtyards sand one of the tigers growled and the links of its chain jangled as the beast lunged towards the smell of fresh blood we shall beat him until we have the name the officer told lawford mildly and when he is dead we shall beat you until you are dead the jetti struck down again and this time sharpe rolled onto his side but the second jetti pushed him back onto his belly sharpe was grunting and panting but was determined not to cry aloud you cant do this lawford protested of course we can the officer answered we shall start splintering his bones now but not his spine not yet we want the pain to go on he nodded and the jetti slashed down again and this time sharpe did cry aloud as the stab of pain brought back all the agony of the flogging a merchant lawford blurted out the officer held up his hand to stop the beating a merchant lieutenant the city is full of merchants he deals in metals lawford said i dont know more than that of course you do the officer said then nodded at the jetti who raised the ramrod high in the air ravi shekhar lawford shouted the lieutenant was bitterly ashamed for giving the name away and the shame was obvious on his face but nor could lawford stand by and watch sharpe beaten to death he believed or he wanted to believe that he could have endured the pain of the beating himself without betraying the name but it was more than he could bear to watch another man pounded into a bloody pulp ravi shekhar the officer said checking thejettfs stroke and how did you find him we didnt lawford said we didnt know how we were waiting till we spoke some of your language then we were going to ask for him about the city but we havent tried yet sharpe groaned blood trickled down his sides and dripped onto the stones one of the tigers staled beside the wall and the smell of urine filled the courtyard with its thin sour stench the officer who was wearing one of the prized gold tiger medallions about his neck talked with the tippoo who stared dispassionately at sharpe then asked a question and what lieutenant the officer translated would you have told ravi shekhar everything wed discovered about the defences lawford said miserably thats why we were sent and what did you discover how many men you have how many guns how many rockets thats all its enough isnt it lawford retorted the officer translated the answers the tippoo shrugged glanced at lawford then took a small brown leather bag from inside a pocket of his yellow silk tunic he unlaced the bags mouth stepped to sharpes side then trickled salt onto the beaten mans open wounds sharpe hissed with the pain who else would you have told in the city the officer asked there was no one else lawford pleaded in the name of god there was no one else we were told ravi shekhar could get a message out that was all the tippoo believed him lawfords chagrin was so clear and his shame so palpable that he was utterly believable besides the story made sense and so youve never seen ravi shekhar the officer asked never youre looking at him now the officer said gesturing at the tigers his body was fed to the tigers weeks ago oh god lawford said and he closed his eyes as he realized just what an utter failure he had been for a moment he wanted to retch then he controlled the impulse and opened his eyes to watch as the tippoo picked up sharpes red coat and dropped it onto the bloody back for a second the tippoo hesitated wondering whether to release the tigers onto the two men then he turned away take them to the cells he ordered the sacrifice of prisoners had yielded up the traitors and turned the tippoos luck there was no need for a further sacrifice not yet but the tippoo knew that fortune was ever capricious and so the prisoners could wait until another sacrifice was needed and then to guarantee victory or to stave off defeat they would die and till then the tippoo decided they could just rot chapter the dungeons lay in one of the palaces northern courtyards hard under the citys inner mud wall the courtyard stank of sewage the smell powerful enough to make sharpe half retch as he staggered beside lawford at the point of a bayonet the courtyard was a busy place the families of the palace servants lived in low thatched buildings surrounding the yard where their lives were spent cheek by jowl with the tippoos stables and the small enclosure where he kept eight cheetahs he used for hunting gazelles the cheetahs were taken to the hunt in wheeled cages and at first sharpe thought they were to be placed inside one of the barred vehicles but then one of the escorts pushed him past the ponderous carts towards a flight of stone steps that descended to a long narrow trench of stone that lay open to the sky a tall fence of iron bars surrounded the pit that was guarded by a pair of soldiers one of them used a key to open a padlock the size of a mango then the escort shoved sharpe and lawford through the open gate the dungeon guards did not carry muskets but instead had coiled whips in their belts and bellmouthed blunderbusses on their shoulders one of them pointed mutely down the steps and sharpe following lawford down the stairs saw that the trench was a stoneflagged deadend corridor lined on either side with barred cells there were eight cells in the pit four on each side and each separated from its neighbours and from the central trenchlike corridor by iron bars alone but bars that were as thick as a mans wrist the turnkey indicated that they should wait while he unlocked a cell but the first padlock he attempted to open had become stiff or else had rusted for it would not budge and then he could not find a key to fit another of the big old locks something stirred in the straw of the cell that lay at the far righthand end of the corridor sharpe waiting as the guard sorted through his keys heard the straw rustle again then there was a growl as a huge tiger heaved up from its bed to stare at them with blank yellow eyes more straw stirred in the first cell on the left close by where sharpe and lawford were standing look who it isnt hakeswill had come to the bars sharpie be quiet sergeant lawford snapped yes sir mister lieutenant lawford sir quiet it is sir hakeswill clung to the bars of his cage staring wideeyed at the two newcomers his face twitched quiet as the grave sir but no one talks to me down here he wont he nodded towards the cell opposite that the guard was now unlocking likes it quiet he does hakeswill went on like a bleeding church says his prayers too always quiet it is here except when the darkies are having a shout at each other dirty bastards they are smell the sewage can you one giant jakes hakeswills face twisted in rictus and in the gloom of the shadowed cells his eyes seemed to glitter with an unholy delight been missing company i have bastard sharpe muttered quiet both of you lawford insisted and then with his innate politeness the lieutenant nodded thanks to the guard who had finally opened the cell directly opposite hakeswills lair come on sharpe lawford said then stepped fastidiously into the filthy straw the cell was eight foot deep and ten foot long and a little over the height of a man the sewage smell was rank but no worse than in the courtyard above the barred door clashed shut behind them and the key was turned willie a tired voice said from the shadows of the cell how very good of you to visit me sharpe his eyes accustoming themselves to the dimness of the dungeons saw that colonel mccandless had been crouching in one corner half shrouded by straw the colonel now stood to greet them but he was weak for he tottered as he stood though he shook off lawfords attempt to help him a fever he explained it comes and it goes ive had it for years i suspect the only thing that will cure it will be some soft scottish rain but that seems an ever more unlikely prospect it is good to see you willie you too sir youve met private sharpe i think mccandless gave sharpe a grim look i have a question for you young man it wasnt gunpowder sir sharpe said remembering his first confrontation with the colonel and thus anticipating the question it tasted wrong sir wasnt salty aye it didnt look like powder the scotsman said it was blowing in the wind like flour but that wasnt my question private my question private is what would you have done if it had been gunpowder id have shot you sir sharpe said begging your pardon sir sharpe lawford remonstrated quite right man mccandless said the wretched fellow was testing you wasnt he he was giving you a recruitment test and you couldnt fail it im glad it wasnt powder but i dont mind saying you had me worried for a brief while do you mind if i sit willie im not in my usual good health he sank back into his straw from where he frowned up at sharpe nor are you private are you in pain bastards cracked a rib sir and im bleeding a bit do you mind if i sit sharpe gingerly sat against the side bars of the cell and carefully lifted away the coat that had been draped over his back bit of fresh air will heal it sir he said to lawford who was insisting on examining the newly opened wounds though there was nothing he could do to help them mend you wont get fresh air here mccandless said you smell the sewage you cant miss that smell uncle lawford said its the new inner wall mccandless explained when they built it they cut the city drains so now the night soil cant reach the river and the sewage puddles just east of here some of it seeps away through the water gate but not enough one learns to pray for a west wind he smiled grimly among other things mccandless wanted news not only of what had brought lawford and sharpe into seringapatam but of the sieges progress and he groaned when he heard where the british had placed their works so harris is coming from the west yes sir straight into the tippoos loving arms the scotsman sat quietly for a moment sometimes shivering because of his fever he had wrapped himself in straw again but he was still cold despite the days intense damp heat and you couldnt get a message out no i suppose not those things are never easy he shook his head lets hope the tippoo doesnt finish his mine its near finished sir sharpe delivered yet more bad news i saw it aye it would be hes an efficient man the tippoo mccandless said efficient and clever cleverer than his father and old hyder ali was canny enough i never met him but i think id have liked the old rogue this son now i never met him either until i was captured and i wish i hadnt hes a good soldier but a bad enemy mccandless closed his eyes momentarily as a shudder racked his body what will he do with us lawford asked that i cannot say colonel mccandless replied tt depends probably on his dreams hes not as good a muslim as hed like us to think for he still believes in some older magic and he sets great store by his dreams if his dreams tell him to kill us then doubtless well have our heads turned back to front like the unfortunate gentlemen who shared these cells with me until quite recently you heard about them we heard lawford said murdered to amuse the tippoos troops mccandless said disapprovingly and there were some good christian men among them too only that thing over there survived he jerked his head towards hakeswilts cell he survived sir sharpe said vengefully because he betrayed us its a lie sir hakeswill who had been avidly listening to sharpe and lawfords tale snapped indignantly from across the corridor a filthy lie sir as id expect from a gutter soldier like private sharpe mccandless turned to gaze at the sergeant then why were you spared he asked coldly touched by god sir always have been sir cant be killed sir mad mccandless said quietly you can be killed obadiah sharpe said christ if it wasnt for you you bastard id have taken our news to general harris lies sir more lies hakeswill insisted quiet both of you mccandless said and private sharpe sir id be grateful if you did not blaspheme remember that thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain exodus twenty verse seven amen sir hakeswill called and praise the lord sir sorry sir sharpe muttered you do know your ten commandments dont you sharpe mccandless asked no sir not one of them mccandless asked shocked thou shalt not be found out sir is that one of them sharpe asked guilelessly mccandless stared at him in horror do you have any religion sharpe no sir never found a need for it you were born with a hunger for it man the colonel spoke with some of his old energy and for a few things else sir mccandless shivered under his mantle of straw if god spares me sharpe i may attempt to repair some of die damage to your immortal soul do you still have the bible your mother gave you willie they took it from me sir lawford said but i did manage to save one page he took the single page from his trouser pocket he was blushing for both he and sharpe knew why the page had been torn from the holy book and it was not for any purpose that colonel mccandless would have approved just the one page sir lawford said apologetically give it here man mccandless said fiercely and let us see what the good lord has to say to us he took the crumpled page smoothed it and tipped it to the light ah the revelation he seemed pleased blessed are the dead which die in the lord he read aloud amen to that not very cheerful sir sharpe ventured it is the most cheerful thing i can contemplate in this place private a promise from the lord god almighty himself that when i die i shall be carried into his glory the colonel smiled for that consolation might i assume private that you cannot read me sir no sir never taught sir hes stupid sir he is sir hakeswill offered from across the corridor always was sir dumb as a bucket we must teach you your letters mccandless said ignoring the sergeants comments mister lawford was going to do that sir sharpe said then i suggest he begins now mccandless said firmly lawford smiled diffidently its difficult to know where to begin uncle why not with t for tiger mccandless suggested the beast growled then settled in its straw and sharpe some years late began his lessons the siege works advanced fast redcoats and sepoys worked day and night sapping forward and shoring up the trench sides with bamboo mats rockets continually harassed the work and the tippoo succeeded in remounting some of his guns on the western walls though their fire did little to disturb the work and the gunners suffered grievously from the counter fire of the british eighteenpounders emplaced in the captured mill fort smaller guns twelvepounders and shortbarrelled howitzers joined the bombardment of the ramparts and their shells and round shot seared above the ground where yard by yard the red earth was broken until at last the big shortrange breaching batteries were dug and the rest of the massive siege guns were rolled forward in the night and concealed in their gun pits to the tippoos troops watching from the battered summit of the western wall the approaches to the city were now a maze of newly turned earth approach trenches angled their way across the farmland ending in larger mounds of earth thrown up from the deeper pits that held the breaching guns not all those bigger mounds concealed guns for some of the spoil heaps were deliberately thrown up as deceptions so that the tippoo could not guess where the real guns were emplaced until they opened fire the tippoo only knew that the british would aim at his western wall but he did not yet know the exact stretch of wall that the enemy engineers had chosen and it suited general harris that the tippoo should not learn that spot until it was necessary for the breaching batteries to open fire if the defenders had too much warning of the place chosen for the storm then they would have time to build elaborate new defences behind it but the tippoo was gambling that he already knew where the british would choose to make their breach and in the old gatehouse where the massive mine was concealed his engineers finished their preparations they stacked stone around the vast powder charge so that its explosion would be directed northwards into the space between the walls for the mine to be effective the british had to site their breach in the short stretch of wall between the old gatehouse and the citys northwest bastion and the tippoos gamble was not an outrageous risk for it was not difficult to forecast that the breach would indeed be blasted in that section of wall the site was dictated by the outer walls decay and by the shortcomings of the low glacis that lay outside that inviting wall the rudimentary glacis half protected most of the citys western battlements its raw earth slope designed to deflect cannonballs up from the walls base but where the city wall was most decayed the river ran very close to the defences and there had been no room to construct even the pretence of a glacis instead a low mud wall continued the line of the glacis and that wall penned in the water that had been pumped into the ditch between the outer ramparts and the glacis that low wall was no obstacle compared to a glacis and the tippoo reckoned it would be an irresistible target for the enemy engineers he did not put all his faith in the single massive mine that mine could well kill or maim hundreds of the assaulting troops but there were thousands more enemy soldiers who could be sent against the city and so the tippoo prepared his army for its test the western walls would be crammed with men when the time came and those men would each have at least three loaded muskets and behind each fighting soldier would be men trained to reload the discharged weapons the british storm would thus be met with a blistering hail of musket fire and mixed with that maelstrom of lead would be round shot and canister fired from the cannons that had replaced the destroyed guns and which were now concealed behind the mutilated ramparts thousands of rockets were also ready at long range the weapon was erratic but in the close confines of a breach where men were crammed as tight as sheep in a pen the rockets could inflict a dreadful slaughter we shall stuff hell with infidel souls the tippoo boasted though at every prayer time he took care to beseech allah for an early monsoon and every dawn he would look at the sky in hope of seeing some signs of rain but the skies remained obstinately clear an early monsoon would drown the british in torrential rain before the rockets and guns could cut them to bloody shreds but it seemed the rains would not come early to mysore this year the skies might be clear but every other omen was good the ill luck that had led to the loss of the mill fort had been diverted by the sacrifice of the british prisoners and now the tippoos dreams and auguries spoke only of victory the tippoo recorded his dreams each morning writing them down in a large book before discussing their portents with his advisers his diviners peered into pots of heated oil to read the shifting coloured swirls on the surface and those shimmering signs like the dreams forecast a great victory the british would be destroyed in southern india and then when the french sent troops to reinforce mysores growing empire the redcoats would be scoured from the north of the country their bones would bleach on the sites of their defeats and their silken colours would fade on the walls of the tippoos great palaces the tiger would rule from the snowy mountains of the north to the palmedged beaches of the south and from the coromandel coast to the seas off malabar all that glory was foretold by the dreams and by the glistening auguries of the oil but then one dawn it seemed the auguries might be deceiving for the british suddenly unmasked four of their newly made breaching batteries and the great guns crashed back on their trails and the intricate network of trenches and earthworks was shrouded by the giant gusts of smoke that were belched out with every thunderous recoil the balls were not aimed where the tippoo had hoped at the vulnerable part of the wall behind the missing section of glacis but at the citys mighty northwest bastion a complex of battlements that loomed high above the river and from its topmost ramparts dominated both the northern and western walls the whole city seemed to shake as the balls slammed home again and again and every strike sprang dust from the old masonry until at last the first stones fell from the north bank of the river where the smaller british camp was sited more guns added their fire and still more stones tumbled down into the ditches as the gunners gnawed away at the great bastion next day more of the siege guns opened fire but these new weapons were aimed at the cavaliers at the very southern end of the western wall there were small cannon mounted in those cavaliers but their embrasures were destroyed in less than a mornings work and the defenders guns were hurled back off their carriages and still the batteries hammered at the northwest bastion until an hour after midday the great fortification collapsed at first the sound of the bastions fall was like the creak and groan of a deep earthquake then it turned into a rumble like thunder as the massive battlements disintegrated beneath a huge cloud of dust that slowly drifted to settle on the cauvery so that for almost a mile downstream the water was turned as white as milk there was an eerie silence after the bastion had been toppled for the besiegers guns had fallen silent the tippoos troops rushed to the walls their muskets and rockets ready but no attackers stirred from the british lines their impudent flags flapped in the breeze but the redcoats and their native allies stayed in their trenches a brave man of the tippoos army ventured up the mound of rubble that had been the northwest corner of the citys defences dust coated the tiger stripes of his tunic as he clambered across the unsteady ruins to find the green flag that had been flying from the bastions topmost rampart he retrieved the flag shook the dust from its folds and waved it in the air one enemy gunner saw the movement on top of the rubble heap and fired his huge gun the ball screamed through the dust ricocheted from a boulder and bounced on up over the northern defences to fall into the whitened river the soldier unscathed waved the flag again then planted its broken staff at the summit of the bastions ruins the tippoo inspected the damage to his western defences the guns were gone from the southern cavaliers and the northwest bastion was untenable but there was no breach in either place and both the outer and inner walls were undamaged the low glacis had protected the bottom part of the walls and though some of the northwest bastions stones had fallen into the flooded ditch there was no ramp up which a storming party could climb what they were doing the tippoo announced to his entourage was destroying our flanking guns which means they still plan to attack in the centre of the wall which is where we want them to attack colonel gudin agreed for a time like the tippoo he had been worried that the british bombardment meant that they planned to enter the city at its northwestern corner but now in the lull after the collapse of the towers the enemys strategy seemed plain they had not been trying to make a breach but instead had knocked down the two places where the tippoo could mount high guns to plunge their fire onto the flanks of the storming troops the breach would be made next it will be where we want it to be im sure gudin confirmed the tippoos guess the man who had planted the flag on the crest of the fallen bastion was brought to the tippoo on the western wall close to where the towers had fallen the tippoo rewarded him with a purse of gold the man was a hindu and that pleased the tippoo who worried about such mens loyalties is he one of yours he asked appah rao who was accompanying the tippoo on the inspection no your majesty the tippoo suddenly turned and gazed up into the tall appah raos face he was frowning those wretched men of gudins the tippoo said wasnt there a woman with them yes your majesty and didnt she go to your house the tippoo charged appah rao she did highness but she died appah rao told the lie smoothly the tippoo was intrigued died she was a drab sick creature appah rao said carelessly and just died as should the men who brought her here he still feared that the arrest of sharpe and lawford could lead to his own betrayal and though he did not truly wish them dead nor did he wish the tippoo to believe that he desired them to live those two will die the tippoo promised grimly his query about mary apparently forgotten they will surely die he promised again as he clambered up the ruins of the northwestern bastion we shall either offer their black souls to avert ill fortune or we shall sacrifice them as thanks for our victory he would prefer the latter and he imagined killing the two men on the very same day that he first ascended the silver steps of his tiger throne the throne he had sworn never to use until his enemies were destroyed he felt a fierce pang of anticipation the redcoats would come to his city and there they would be seared by the fires of vengeance and crushed by falling stone their groans would echo through the days of their dying and then the rains would come and the sluggish cauvery would swell into its full drowning spate and the remaining british who were already low on food would have no choice but to withdraw they would leave their guns behind and begin their long journey across mysore and every mile of their retreat would be dogged by the tippoos lancers and sabremen the vultures would grow fat this year and a trail of sunwhitened bones would be left across india until the very last redcoated man died and there the tippoo decided where the last englishman died he would erect a high pillar of marble white and gleaming and crowned with a snarling tigers head the muezzins call echoed across the city summoning the faithful to prayer the sound was beautiful in the silence after the guns the tippoo obedient to his god hurried towards his palace with one last backward glance at the damned they could make their breach they could cross the river and they could come to his walls but once at the walls they would die tik sharpe said scratching the letters in the dust of the cells floor where he had cleared a patch of straw lok picklock lawford said very good but youve left out two cv but ive got the picklock sir sharpe said and produced it from his coat pocket it was a small cluster of metal shafts some curiously bent at their tips which he quickly hid once he had shown it to lawford why didnt they find it lawford asked both men had been searched when they had been taken to the palace after their arrest and though the guards had left the page of the bible in lawfords pocket they had taken everything else of value i had it somewhere it couldnt be found sir sharpe said colonel gudin thought i was scratching my arse if you follow me but i was hiding it id rather not know lawford said primly a good picklock like that can take care of those old padlocks in seconds sir sharpe said nodding at the lock on their cell door then we just have to rush the guards and get a bellyful of lead lawford suggested when the assault comes sharpe said the guards will like as not be at the top of the steps trying to see whats happening they wont hear us sharpes back was still painful and the wounds inflicted by the jetti were crusted with dried blood and pus that tore whenever he moved too quickly but there was no gangrene and he had been spared any fever and that good fortune was restoring his confidence when the assault comes sharpe colonel mccandless intervened our guards are more likely to be on the walls leaving our security to the tiger hadnt thought of that sir sharpe sounded disappointed i dont think even you can rush a tiger mccandless said no sir i dont suppose i can sharpe admitted each night at dusk the guards left the cells but first they released the tiger it was a difficult process for the tiger had to be held away from the guards with long spears as they retreated up the steps it had evidently tried to charge the guards once for it bore a long scar down one muscular striped flank and these days to prevent another such attack the guards tossed down a great chunk of raw goat meat to satisfy the tigers hunger before they released it and the prisoners would spend the night hours listening to the creature grinding and slavering as it ripped the last pieces of flesh from the bones each dawn the tiger was herded back to its cell where it slept through the heat of the day until its time for guard duty came again it was a huge and mangy beast not nearly so sleek as the six tigers kept in the palace yard but it had a hungrier look and sometimes in the moonlight sharpe would watch it pacing up and down the short corridor the fall of its pads silent on the stone as it endlessly went up and down up and down and he wondered what tiger thoughts brewed behind its nightglossed yellow eyes sometimes for no reason it would roar in the night and the hunting cheetahs would call back and the night would be loud with the sound of the animals then the tiger would leap lithely up the steps and roar another challenge from the bars at the head of the staircase it always came back down its approach silent and its gaze malevolent by day when the tiger twitched in its sleep the guards would watch the cells sometimes there were just two guards but at other times there were as many as six each morning a pair of prisoners from the citys civilian jail arrived in leg irons to take away the nightsoil buckets and when these had been emptied and returned the first meal was served it was usually cold rice sometimes with beans or scraps of fish in it with a tin jug of water a second pail of rice was brought in the afternoon but otherwise the prisoners were left alone they listened to the sounds above them ever fearful that they might be summoned to face the tippoos dreaded killers and while they waited mccandless prayed hakeswill mocked lawford worried and sharpe learned his letters at first the learning was hard and it was made no easier by hakeswills constant scoffing lawford and mccandless would tell the sergeant to be quiet but after a while hakeswill would chuckle again and start talking ostensibly to himself in the far corner of his cage above himself aint he hakeswill would mutter just loud enough for sharpe to hear got hairs and bleeding graces thats what sharpies got hairs and graces learning to read might as well teach a stone to fart it aint natural aint right a private soldier should know his place says so in the scriptures it says nothing of the sort sergeant mccandless would always snap after such an assertion and always every daylight hour of every day there was the sound of the besiegers guns their thunderous percussions filled the sky and were echoed by the crack of iron on sundried mud as the eighteenpound round shots struck home while nearer the tippoos own guns answered few such cannon had survived on the western walls but closer to the dungeons on the northern rampart the tippoos gunners traded shot for shot with the batteries across the cauvery and the sound of the weapons punched the warm air incessantly working hard them gunners hakeswill would say doing a proper job like real soldiers should working up a proper muck sweat not wasting their time with bleeding letters cat who the hell needs to know that its still a bleeding pussy cat all you needs to know is how to skin the thing not how to spell it quiet sergeant mccandless would growl yes sir i shall be quiet sir like a church mouse sir but a few moments later the sergeant could be heard grumbling again private morgan i remembers him and he could read and he wasnt nothing but trouble he always knew more than anyone else but he didnt know better than to be flogged did he would never have happened if he hadnt had his letters his mother taught him the silly welsh bitch he read his bible when he should have been cleaning his musket died under the lash he did and good riddance a private soldiers got no business reading bad for the eyes sends you blind hakeswill even talked at night sharpe would wake to hear the sergeant talking in a low voice to the tiger and one night even the tiger stopped to listen youre not such a bad puss are you hakeswill crooned down here all alone you are just like me the sergeant reached a tentative hand through the bars and gave the beasts back a swift pat he was rewarded with a low snarl dont you growl at me puss or ill have your bleeding eyes out and how will you catch mouses then eh youll be a hungry blind pussy cat thats what youll be thats it lay you down now and rest your big head see doesnt hurt does it and the sergeant reached out and with remarkable tenderness scratched the big cats flank and to sharpes wonder the huge beast settled itself comfortably against the bars of the sergeants cell youre awake arent you sharpie hakeswill called softly as he scratched the tiger i knows you are i can tell so what happened to little mary bickerstaff eh you going to tell me boy some heathen darkie got his filthy hands on her has he shed have done better lifting her skirts to me instead shes being rogered by some blackie aint she is that what happened still now still he soothed the tiger sharpe pretended to be asleep but hakeswill must have sensed his attention officers pet sharpie is that what you are learning to read so you can be like them is that what you want it wont do you no good boy theres only two sorts of officers in this army and the one sorts good and the other sort aint the good sort knows better than to get their hands dirty with you rankers they leave it all to the sergeants the bad sort interfere that young mister fitzgerald he was an interferer but hes gone to hell now and hells the best place for him seeing as how he was an upstart irishman with no respect for sergeants and your mister lawford he aint no good either no good at all hakeswill suddenly quietened as colonel mccandless groaned the colonels fever was growing worse though he tried hard not to complain sharpe abandoning his pretence of sleep carried the water bucket to him drink sir thats kind of you sharpe kind the colonel drank then propped his back against the stone wall at the back of the cell we had a rainstorm last month he said not a severe one but these cells were flooded all the same and not all of the flooding was rain a good deal was sewage i pray god gets us out of here before the monsoon no chance of us still being here then is there sir it depends sharpe whether we take the city or not we will sir sharpe said maybe the colonel smiled at sharpes serene confidence but the tippoo might decide to kill us first mccandless fell silent for a while then shook his head i wish i understood the tippoo nothing to understand sir hes just an evil bastard sir no hes not that the colonel said severely hes actually rather a good ruler better i suspect than most of our christian monarchs hes certainly been good for mysore hes fetched it a deal of wealth given it more justice than most countries enjoy in india and hes been tolerant to most religions though i fear he did persecute some unfortunate christians the colonel grimaced as a shudder racked his body hes even kept the rajah and his family alive not in comfort but alive and thats more than most monarchs would ever do most usurpers kill their countrys old ruler but not here i cant forgive him for what he did to those poor prisoners of ours of course but i suppose some capricious cruelty is probably necessary in a ruler all in all i think and judging him by the standards of our own monarchy we should have to give the tippoo fairly high marks so why the hell are we fighting him sir mccandless smiled because we want to be here and he doesnt want us to be here two dogs in a small cage sharpe and if he beats us out of mysore hell bring in the french to chase us out of the rest of india and then we can bid farewell to the best part of our eastern trade thats what its about sharpe trade thats why youre fighting here trade sharpe grimaced it seems a funny thing to be fighting about sir does it mccandless seemed surprised not to me sharpe without trade theres no wealth and without wealth theres no society worth having without trade private sharpe wed be nothing but beasts in the mud trade is indeed worth fighting for though the good lord knows we dont appreciate trade much we celebrate kings we honour great men we admire aristocrats we applaud actors we shower gold on portrait painters and we even sometimes reward soldiers but we always despise merchants but why its the merchants wealth that drives the mills sharpe it moves the looms it keeps the hammers falling it fills the fleets it makes the roads it forges the iron it grows the wheat it bakes the bread and it builds the churches and the cottages and the palaces without god and trade we would be nothing sharpe laughed softly trade never did owt for me sir did it not mccandless asked gently the colonel smiled so what do you think is worth fighting for private friends sir and pride we have to show that were better bastards than the other side you dont fight for king or country tve never met the king sir never even seen him hes not much to look at but hes a decent enough man when hes not mad mccandless stared across at hakeswill is he mad i think so sir poor soul hes evil too sharpe said speaking too softly for hakeswill to hear him takes a joy sir in having men punished he thieves he lies he rapes he murders and youve done none of those things never raped sir and as for the others only when i had to then i pray god youll never have to again mccandless said fervently and with that he leaned his grey head against the wall and tried to sleep sharpe watched the dawn light seep into the dungeon pit the last bats of the night wheeled in the patch of sky above but soon they were gone and the first gun of the day spoke it was clearing its throat as the gunners liked to say for the city and its besiegers were waking and the fight would go on the opening shot of the day was aimed at the low mud wall that plugged the gap in the glacis and kept the water dammed in the ditch behind the wall was thick and the shot which fell low and so lost much of its force as it ricocheted up from the river bank did little more than shiver dust from the walls crevices one by one the other siege guns woke and had their throats blasted clear the first few shots were often lackadaisical as the gun barrels were still cool and thus caused the balls to fly low a handful of guns answered the fire from the city walls but none of them was large the tippoo was hiding his big guns for the assault but he permitted his gunners to mount and fire their small cannon some of which discharged a ball no bigger than a grapeshot the defenders fire did no damage but even the sound of their guns gave the citizens a feeling that they were fighting back this morning the british guns seemed erratic every battery was at work but their fire was uncoordinated some aimed at the wall in the glacis while others targeted the higher ramparts but an hour after dawn they all fell silent and a moment later the tippoos gunners also ceased firing colonel gudin staring through a spyglass from the western ramparts distinctly saw the sepoy gunners in one breaching battery heaving at the trail of their piece gudin reckoned that the big guns were at last being carefully aligned on the section of wall that had been chosen for the breach the guns were hot now they would fire true and soon they would concentrate a dreadful intensity of iron against the chosen spot in the citys defences with his spyglass he could see men straining at the gun but he could not see the gun itself for the embrasure had been momentarily stopped up with wicker baskets filled with earth gudin prayed that the british would take the tippoos bait and aim their pieces at the weakest section of the wall he trained his glass on the nearest battery which was scarce four hundred yards from the vulnerable section of wall the gunners were stripped to the waist and no wonder for the temperature would soon be well over ninety degrees and the humidity was already stifling and these men had to handle enormous weights of gun and shot an eighteenpounder siege gun weighed close to twelve tons and all that mass of hot metal was hurled back with each shot and the gun then had to be manhandled back into its firing position the shot of such a gun measured a little over five inches across and each gun could fire perhaps one such ball every two minutes and the tippoos spies had reported that general harris now had thirtyseven of these heavy guns and two more cannon even heavier that each fired a twentyfourpound missile gudin waiting for the gunfire to start again made a simple computation in his head each minute he reckoned about three hundred and fifty pounds of iron travelling at unimaginably high velocities would hammer into the city wall and to that hefty weight of metal the british could add a score of howitzers and several dozen twelvepounders that would be used to bombard the walls either side of the place general harris had chosen to make his breach gudin knew that the serious business of making the breach was about to begin and he almost held his breath as he waited for the first shot for that opening gun would tell him whether or not the tippoos gamble had succeeded the waiting seemed to stretch for ever but at last one of the batteries unmasked a gun and the great brute belched a jet of smoke fifty yards in front of its embrasure the sound came a halfsecond later but gudin had already seen the shot fall the british had swallowed the bait they were coming straight for the trap the rest of the breaching guns now opened fire for a moment a rumbling thunder filled the sky that was flapping with the wings of startled birds the shots seared over the dry land across the river and slammed into the brief curtain wall that joined the sections of glacis the wall lasted less than ten minutes before an eighteenpounder shot pierced through it and suddenly the water of the inner ditch was gushing out into the south cauvery for a few seconds the water was a clear thin spurt arcing out to the river then the force of the flow abraded the remaining mud and the wall collapsed so that a murky flood washed irresistibly down the river bank the guns scarcely paused only now they raised their aim very slightly so mat the balls could strike against the base of the outer rampart which had been completely unmasked by the collapse of the glaciss brief connecting wall shot after shot slammed home their impacts reverberating down the whole length of the ancient battlements and each shot punched out a handful of mud bricks the water from the punctured ditch kept flowing out and the shots kept slamming home as the gunners sweated and hauled and spiked and sponged out and rammed and fired again all day long they fired and all day long the old wall crumbled the shots were kept low aimed to strike at the foot of the wall so that the bricks above would collapse to make a ramp of rubble that would lead up and through the gap that the guns were making by nightfall the wall still stood but at its base there was a crumbling dusty cavern that had been carved deep into the rampart a few british guns fired in the night mostly scattering canister or grapeshot in an attempt to stop the tippoos men from repairing the cavern but in the dark it was difficult to keep the guns aimed true and most of the shots went wild and in the morning the british gunners pointed their telescopes and saw that the cavern had been plugged with earthfilled wicker gabions and baulks of timber the first few shots made short shrift of those repairs scattering the timber and soil in huge gouts as the balls bit home and once the cavern was reexposed the gunners went to work on it the land between the aqueduct and the river became shrouded with a mist of powder smoke as the artillery poured in their fire until at midday a cheer from the british lines marked the walls collapse it crumpled slowly jetting a cloud of dust into the air a cloud so thick that at first no man could see the extent of the damage but as the small wind cleared the smoke away from the guns and the dust from the wall they could see that a breach had been made the limewashed wall now had a gap twenty yards wide and the gap was filled with a mound of rubble up which a man could climb so long as he was unencumbered by anything other than a musket a bayonet and his cartridge box that made the breach practicable yet still the guns fired now the gunners were trying to flatten the slope of the breach and some of their shots ricocheted up to the inner wall and for a time gudin feared that the british were planning to blast a passage clean through that new inner rampart but then the gunners lowered their aim to keep their balls hammering at the newly made breach or else to gnaw at the shoulders of the outer walls gap a halfmile away from gudin in the british lines general harris and general baird stared at the breach through their telescopes now for the first time they could inspect a short stretch of the new inner wall it isnt as high as i feared harris commented lets pray its unfinished baird growled but still i think its better to ignore it harris decreed capture the outer wall first baird turned to stare at some clouds that lay heavy and low on the western horizon he feared the clouds presaged rain we could go tonight sir he suggested baird was remembering the fortyfour months he had endured in the tippoos dungeons some of them spent chained to the wall of his cell and he wanted revenge he was also eager to get the bloody business of storming the city done harris collapsed his glass tomorrow he said firmly and scratched beneath the edge of his wig we risk more by rushing things well do it properly and well do it tomorrow that night a handful of british officers crept out from the leading trenches with small white cotton flags attached to bamboo poles the sky was laced with a tracery of thin clouds that intermittently hid the waning moon and in the cloud shadows the officers explored the south cauvery to find the rivers treacherous deep pools they marked the shallows with their flags and so pointed the path towards the breach and all through that night the assault troops filed down the long trenches harris was determined that his assault would be overwhelming he would not tickle the city he told baird but swamp it with men and so baird would lead two columns of troops half of them british and half sepoys but nearly all of them prime men from the armys elite flanking companies the six thousand attackers would either be grenadiers who were the biggest and strongest men or else from the light companies who were the quickest and cleverest soldiers and those picked men would be accompanied by a detachment of hyderabads finest warriors the attackers would also be accompanied by engineers carrying fascines to fill in any ditches that the defenders might have dug on the breachs summit and bamboo ladders to scale the edges of the breach volunteer gunners would follow the leading troops up onto the ramparts and there turn the tippoos own cannon against the defenders on the inner wall two forlorn hopes would go ahead of the columns each hope composed solely of volunteers and each led by a sergeant who would be made an officer if he survived both the forlorn hopes would carry the british colours into the breach and those colour bearers would be the very first men to climb into the enemys guns once on the breach the forlorn hopes were ordered not to go on into the space between the walls but to climb the broken stumps of the shoulders either side of the breachs ramp and from there lead the fight north and south around the whole ring of seringapatams ramparts god knows harris said that night at supper but i can think of nothing left undone can you baird no sir i cant baird said upon my soul i cant he was trying to sound cheerful but it was still a subdued meal though harris had done his best to make it festive his table was spread with a linen cloth and was lit by fine spermaceti candles that burned with a pure white light the generals cooks had killed their last chickens to provide a change from the usual halfration of beef but none of the officers round the table had much appetite nor it seemed any enthusiasm for conversation meer allum the commander of the hyderabad army did his best to encourage his allies but only wellesley seemed capable of responding to his remarks colonel gent who as well as being harriss chief engineer had taken on himself the collation of what intelligence came out of the city poured himself some wine it was rancid stuff soured by its long journey from europe and by the heat of india theres a rumour he said heavily when a break in the desultory conversation had stretched for too long that the heathen bastards have planted a mine there are always such rumours baird said curtly a bit late to tell us surely harris remonstrated mildly only heard of it today sir gent said defensively one of their cavalry fellows deserted he could be making up tales missing page would regard the appointment as a slight yet in truth bairds hatred of all things indian disqualified him from such a post britain needed a friendly mysore and wellesley was a tactful man who harboured no prejudice against natives good of you wellesley harris said when the toast had been drunk very good of you im sure this time tomorrow meer allum said in his odd english accent we shall all dine in the tippoos palace drink from his silver and eat from his gold i pray that we do harris said and i pray we manage it without grievous loss he scratched his old wound beneath his wig the officers were still sombre when the meal ended harris bade them a good night then stood for a while outside his tent staring at the moonglossed walls of the distant city the limewashed ramparts seemed to glow white beckoning him but to what he went to his bed where he slept badly and in his waking moments found himself rehearsing excuses for failure baird also stayed awake for a while but drank a good measure of whisky and afterwards in full uniform and with his big claymore propped beside his cot he slipped in and out of a restless sleep wellesley slept well the men crammed in the trenches hardly slept at all bugles greeted the dawn the storm clouds had thickened in the west but there was no rain and the rising sun soon burned the small wispy clouds from above the city the assaulting troops crouched in the trenches where they could not be seen from seringapatams walls the small white flags fluttered in the river the siege guns kept firing some attempting to open the breach wider but most just trying to discourage the defenders from making any attempt to repair the breach or place obstacles on its forward slope the undamaged ramparts gleamed white in the sun while the breach appeared as a redbrown scar in the long city wall the tippoo had spent the night in a small sentry shelter on the north walls he woke early for he expected an attack at dawn and he had ordered that all his soldiers should be ready on the walls but no assault came and as the sun climbed higher he allowed some of the defenders back to their barracks to rest while he himself went to the inner palace he sensed a nervous expectancy in the crowded streets and he himself was a troubled man for during his restless night he had dreamed of monkeys and monkeys were ever a bad omen and the tippoos mood was not helped when his diviners reported that the oil in their pots had been clouded today it seemed was an inauspicious day but luck as the tippoo knew was malleable and he attempted to change the days illstarred beginning by giving gifts he summoned a hindu priest and presented the man with an elephant a sack of oilseed and a purse of gold to the brahmins who accompanied the priest he gave a bullock a nanny goat two buffalo a black hat a black coat and one of his precious pots of divining oil then he washed his hands and donned a clothpadded war helmet that had been dipped in a sacred fountain to make its wearer invulnerable on his right arm his sword arm he wore a silver amulet inscribed with verses from the koran a servant pinned the great red ruby onto the helmets plume the tippoo slung the goldhilted sword at his waist then went back to the western walls nothing had changed beyond the gently flowing south cauvery the sun baked the ground where the british guns still fired their massive round shots churned up the rubble ramp but no redcoats stirred from their trenches and the only signs that an assault might be imminent were the small pennants stuck in the river bed they want another day to widen the breach an officer opined colonel gudin shook his head theyll come today he insisted the tippoo grunted he was standing just north of the breach from where he watched the enemy trenches through a spyglass some of the british round shot struck dangerously close to where he stood and his aides tried to persuade him to move to a safer place but even when a stone shard thrown up by a cannonball flicked at his white linen tunic he would not move they would have come at dawn he finally said if they were coming today they want us to think that gudin protested to lull us but they will come today they wont give us another night to make preparations and why plant the flags he pointed at the river the tippoo stepped back from the remains of the parapet was his luck changed he had given gifts to the enemies of his god in the hope that his god would then reward him with victory but he still felt an unease he would much have preferred that the storming should be delayed another day so that another set of auspices could be taken but perhaps allah willed it otherwise and nothing would be lost by assuming that the attack would come this day assume they will come this afternoon he ordered every man back to the walls the walls already thick with troops now became crowded with defenders one company of muslims had volunteered to face the first enemy who came into the breach and those brave men armed with swords pistols and muskets crouched just inside the breach but hidden from the enemys guns by the mound of rubble those volunteers would almost certainly die if not at the hands of the attackers then when the great mine blew but each man had been assured of his place in paradise and so they went gladly to their deaths rockets were piled on the ramparts and guns that had stayed hidden from the bombardment were manhandled into position to take the attackers in the flanks others of the tippoos finest troops were posted on the outer wall above the edges of the breach their job was to defend the shoulders of the breach for the tippoo was determined to funnel the attackers into the space between the walls where his mine could destroy them let the british come the tippoo prayed but let them be shepherded across the breach and into the killing ground the tippoo had decided to lead the fight on the wall north of the breach colonel gudins battalion would fight south of the breach but gudin himself had responsibility for blowing the great mine it was ready now a hoard of powder crammed into the old gate passage and shored up by stones and timber so that the blast of the explosion would be forced northwards between the walls gudin would watch the killing space from his place on the inner rampart then signal to sergeant rothiere to light the fuse rothiere and the fuse were guarded by two of gudins steadiest men and by six of the tippoos jettis the tippoo assured himself that all had been done that could be done the city was ready and in honour of the slaughter of infidels the tippoo had arrayed himself in jewels then consigned his soul and his kingdom into allahs keeping now he could only wait as the latemorning sun climbed higher and yet higher to become a burning whiteness in the indian sky where the vultures circled on their wide ragged wings the british guns fired on in the mosque some men prayed but all of them were old men for any man young enough to fight was waiting on the walls the hindus prayed to their gods while the women of the city made themselves ragged and dirty so that should the city fall they would not attract the enemys attention midday came the city baked in the heat it seemed strangely silent for the fire of the siege guns was desultory now the sound of each shot echoed dully from the walls and each strike would start a trickle of stone and a small cloud of dust and afterwards there would be silence again on the walls a horde of men crouched behind their firesteps while in the trenches across the river an opposing horde waited for the order that would send them against an expectant city the tippoo had a prayer mat brought to the walls and there facing towards the enemy he knelt and bowed in prayer he prayed that colonel gudin was wrong and that his enemies would give him one more day and then as in a waking dream a message came to him he had given gifts and gifts of charity were blessed but he had not made sacrifice he had been saving his sacrifice for the celebration of victory but perhaps victory would not come unless he made his offerings now luck was malleable and death was a great changer of fortune he made a last obeisance touching his forehead to the mats weave then climbed to his feet send for three jettis he ordered an aide and tell them to bring me the british prisoners all of them your majesty the aide asked not the sergeant the tippoo said not the one who twitches the others tell the jettis to bring them here for his victory needed one last sacrifice of blood before the cauvery was made dark with it chapter appah rao was an able man otherwise he would not have been promoted to the command of one of the tippoos brigades but he was also a discreet man discretion had kept rao alive and discretion had enabled him to preserve his loyalty to the unthroned rajah of the house of wodeyar while still serving the tippoo now ordered to take his men to the walls of seringapatam and there fight to preserve the muslim dynasty of the tippoo appah rao at last questioned his discretion he obeyed the tippoo of course and his cushoons filed dutifully enough onto the city ramparts but appah rao standing beneath one of the sun banners above the mysore gate asked himself what he wanted of this world he possessed family high rank wealth and ability yet he still bowed his head to a foreign monarch and some of the flags above his mens heads were inscribed in arabic to celebrate a god who was no god of appah raos his own monarch lived in poverty ever under the threat of execution and it was possible more than possible rao allowed that victory this day would raise the tippoo so high that he would no longer need the small advantage of the rajahs existence the rajah was paraded like a doll on hindu holy days to placate the tippoos hindu subjects but if mysore had no enemies in southern india why should the hindus of mysore need to be placated the rajah and all his family would be secretly strangled and their corpses like the bodies of the twelve murdered british prisoners would be wrapped in reed mats and buried in an unmarked grave but if the tippoo lost then the british would rule in mysore true if they kept their word the rajah would be restored to his palace and to his ancient throne but the power of the palace would still rest with the british advisers and the rajahs treasury would be required to pay for the upkeep of british troops but if the tippoo won appah rao thought then the french would come and what evidence was there that the french were any better than the british he stood above the southern gate waiting for an unseen enemy to erupt from their trenches and assault the city and he felt like a man buffeted between two implacable forces if he had been less discreet he might have considered rebelling openly against the tippoo and ordering his troops to help the invading british but such a risk was too great for a cautious man yet if the tippoo lost this days battle and if appah rao was perceived to be loyal to the defeated man then what future did he have whichever side won appah rao thought he lost but there was one small act that might yet snatch survival from defeat he walked out to the end of a jutting cavalier waved the gunners posted there away from their cannon and beckoned kunwar singh to his side where are your men he asked singh at the house lord kunwar singh was a soldier but not in any of the tippoos cushoons his loyalty was to his kinsman appah rao and his duty was to protect appah rao and his family take six men the general said and make sure they are not dressed in my livery then go to the dungeons find colonel mccandless and take him back to my house he speaks our tongue so gain his trust by reminding him that you came with me to the temple at somanathapura and tell him that i am trusting him to keep my family alive the general had been staring southwards as he spoke but he now turned to look into kunwar singhs eyes if the british do get into the city then mccandless will protect our women appah rao added this last assurance as though to justify the order he was giving but kunwar singh still hesitated singh was a loyal man but that loyalty was being dangerously stretched for he was being asked to rebel against the tippoo he might need to kill the tippoos men to free this enemy soldier and appah rao understood his hesitation do this for me kunwar singh the general promised and i shall restore your familys land lord kunwar singh said then stepped back turned and was gone appah rao watched him go then stared past the citys southwestern corner to where he could see a portion of the enemy trenches it was past noon and there were still no signs of life from the british lines except for a desultory gunshot once in a while if the tippoo won this day appah rao thought then his anger at mccandlesss disappearance would be terrible in which case appah rao decided mccandless must die before he could ever be discovered and have the truth beaten out of him but if the tippoo lost then mccandless was appah raos best guarantor of survival and a hindu living in a muslim state was an expert at survival appah rao despite the risk he was running knew he had acted for the best he drew his sword kissed its blade for luck then waited for the assault it took only a minute for kunwar singh to reach the generals house he ordered six of his best men to discard their tunics which bore appah raos badge and to put on tigerstriped tunics instead he changed his own coat then borrowed a gold chain with a jewelled pendant from the generals treasure chest such a jewel was a sign of authority in the city and kunwar singh reckoned he might need it he armed himself with a pistol and a sword then waited for his picked squad mary came to the courtyard and demanded to know what was happening there was a strange stillness in the city and the tempo of the british guns which had been firing so hard and fast for days was now muted and the ominous silence had made mary nervous we think the british are coming kunwar singh told her then blurted out that she would be safe for he had been ordered to free the british colonel from the dungeons and bring him to the house where mccandlesss presence would protect the women if the british even get through the wall he added dubiously what about my brother mary asked kunwar singh shrugged i have no orders for him then i shall come with you mary declared you cant kunwar singh insisted he was often shocked by marys defiance though he also found it appealing you can stop me she said by shooting me or you can let me come make up your mind she did not wait to hear his answer but hurried to her quarters where she snatched up the pistol that appah rao had given her kunwar singh made no further protest he was confused by what was happening and though he sensed that his masters loyalties were wavering he still did not know which way they would ultimately fall i cant let your brother come back here he warned mary when she came back to the courtyard we can free him mary insisted and after that he can look after himself hes good at that the streets of the city were oddly deserted most of the tippoos soldiers were on the ramparts and anyone who had no business in the coming battle had taken care to lock their doors and stay hidden a few men still trundled handcarts of ammunition and rockets towards the walls but there were no bullock carts and no open shops a few sacred cows wandered the city with sublime unconcern but otherwise it was like a place of ghosts and it only took kunwar singhs small party five minutes to reach the complex of small courtyards that lay to the north of the inner palace no one questioned kunwar singhs right to be in the palace precincts for he wore the tippoos uniform and the jewels hanging about his neck were glittering proof of his authority the difficulty kunwar singh had anticipated would lie in persuading the guards to unlock the gate of the dungeons outer cage once that gate was open the rest should be easy for his men could swiftly overwhelm the guards and so find the key to mccandlesss cell kunwar singh had decided that his best course was simply to pretend to an authority he did not have and claim to bear a summons from the tippoo himself arrogance went far in mysore and he would give it a try otherwise he must order his men to use their muskets to blast the cage doors down and he feared that such a commotion would bring guards running from the nearby inner palace but when he reached the cells he found there were no guards the space within the outer cage and around the stone steps was empty a solther on the inner wall above the cells saw the small group standing uncertainly beside the dungeon gate and assumed they had come to fetch the guards theyve already gone the man shouted down ordered to the walls gone to kill some englishmen kunwar singh acknowledged the man then rattled the gate vainly hoping that the padlock would fall off you dont want to go inside the helpful man called down the tigers on duty kunwar singh instinctively stepped back the soldier above him lost interest and went back to his post as kunwar singh stepped back to the gate and tugged a second time at the huge padlock too big to shoot open he said that lock will take five or six bullets at least we cant get inside mary asked no not without attracting the guards he gestured towards the palace the thought of the tiger had made him nervous and he was wondering whether he would do better to wait until the assault started and then under the cover of its huge noise try to shoot the padlock away from the gate then kill the tiger or else just give up the errand the courtyard stank of sewage and the smell only reinforced kunwar singhs presentiments of failure then mary stepped to the bars richard she called richard there was a momentary pause lass the answer came at last kunwar singhs nervousness increased there were a dozen soldiers on the inner wall immediately above him and a score of other people were peering dirough windows or above stable doors no one was yet taking a suspicious interest in his party but it seemed likely that someone of true authority would soon pass by the dungeons we should leave he hissed to mary we cant get inside mary called to sharpe have you got a gun lass sharpe called back mary could not see him for the outer cage was far enough back from the dungeon steps to hide the cells yes chuck it down here lass chuck it as close to the bottom of the steps as you can make sure the buggers not cocked kunwar singh rattled the gate again the sound of the clangorous iron prompted a growl from the pit and a moment later the tiger loped up the steps stared blankeyed at kunwar singh then turned and went back to the remnants of a halfcarcass of goat we cant wait kunwar singh insisted to mary throw us a gun love sharpe shouted mary groped inside the folds of her sari to find the ivoryinlaid pistol that appah rao had given to her she pushed it through the bars and then very nervously she tried to gauge how much effort would be needed to toss the gun into the pit but not too far from the bottom of the steps kunwar singh hissed at her but made no move to stop her here richard she called and she tossed the gun underarm it was a clumsy throw and the pistol fell short of the steps but its momentum carried it over the edge and mary heard the gun clattering down the stone stairs sharpe cursed for the pistol had lodged three steps up have you got another one he shouted give me your pistol mary said to kunwar singh no we cant get in kunwar singh was close to panic now and his six men had been infected by his fear we cant help them he insisted mary sharpe called im sorry richard not to worry lass sharpe said staring at the pistol he did not doubt he could pick the lock open but could he reach the gun before the tiger reached him and even if he did would one small pistol ball stop eight feet of hungry tiger jesus christ he swore sharpe mccandless chided him i was praying sir because this is a right buggerup sir a right buggerup sharpe took out the picklock and unfolded one of the shafts he put his hands through the bars and grabbed hold of the padlock then explored the big keyhole with the hooked shaft it was a crude lock that ought to be easy to open but the mechanism was not properly oiled and sharpe feared that the picklock might snap rather than move the levers aside lawford and mccandless watched him while from across the corridor hakeswill stared with huge blue eyes go on boy good boy hakeswill said get us out of here boy shut your ugly face obadiah sharpe muttered he had moved one lever now only the second remained but it was much staffer than the first sweat was pouring down sharpes face he was working half blind unable to pull the padlock to an angle where he could see the keyhole the tiger had paused in its eating to watch him intrigued by the hands protruding through the bars sharpe manoeuvred the picklock felt the hook lodge against the lever and gently pressed he pressed harder and suddenly the hook scraped off the levers edge and sharpe swore and just as he swore the tiger twisted and sprang it attacked with appalling speed a sudden unleashing of coiled muscles that ended with a swipe of one unsheathed paw as it tried to hook a claw into the protruding hands sharpe recoiled dropping the picklock and cursing as the tigers slash missed him by inches bastard he swore at the beast then he stooped and reached through the bars for the fallen picklock that lay a foot away he moved fast but the tiger was faster and this time sharpe got a deep scratch on the back of his hand sergeant hakeswill sharpe hissed get the beast over on your side nothing i can do hakeswill protested his face twitching the tiger was watching sharpe it was only two feet away from him its teeth were bared and its claws unsheathed and there was a glint in its yellow eyes you want to fight a tiger sharpie hakeswill said thats your business not mine man doesnt have to fight pussy cats says so in the scriptures you say that one more time mccandless roared in sudden and unexpected fury and ill make sure you never wear stripes again do you understand me man hakeswill was taken aback by the colonels anger sir he said weakly so do as private sharpe says colonel mccandless ordered and do it now hakeswill beat his hands against the bars the tiger turned its head and sharpe immediately snatched the picklock back into the cell and stood again the tiger leapt at hakeswill shaking the bars of his cell with its violence and hakeswill backed hurriedly away keep provoking it man mccandless ordered hakeswill and the sergeant spat at the tiger then threw a handful of straw towards its face sharpe worked on the lock he had the hook against the lever again the tiger roused to a petulant fury stood with its paws against the bars of hakeswills cell as sharpe pressed on the lever and at last felt it move his hands trembled and the hook grated as it slipped across the levers face but he steadied himself and pressed harder he was holding his breath willing the lever to unlatch sweat stung his eyes then suddenly the lever clicked across and the lock sprang open in his hands that was the easy part he said grimly he folded the picklock and put it back in his pocket mary he called there was no answer mary he shouted again but still there was no reply kunwar singh had pulled his men away from the cells and was now in a deep gateway on the courtyards far side trapped between his wish to obey appah rao and the apparent impossibility of that obedience what do you need her for colonel mccandless asked i dont even know if the bloody guns loaded sir i never asked her assume it is mccandless said easy for you sir sharpe said respectfully being as you aint the one whos got to go out and kill the beast ill do it lawford offered sharpe grinned its either you or me sir he said and being honest sir who do you think will do the best job you lawford admitted which is what i reckoned sir but one thing sir how do you shoot a tiger in the head between the eyes mccandless said but not too high up just below the eyes bloody hell sharpe said he had eased the padlock out of its hasp and he could now move the door outwards though he did it gingerly unwilling to attract the tigers attention he pulled the door shut again and stooped for his red jacket that lay on the straw lets hope the buggers a stupid pussy cat he said then he gently pushed the door open again the hinges squealed alarmingly he had the door in his left hand and his red coat was bundled in his right when the door was open a foot he tossed the coat as hard as he could towards the remains of the goat at the corridors farther end the tiger saw the motion twisted away from hakeswills cage and sprang towards the coat the red jacket had flown the best part of twenty feet and the tiger covered the distance in one powerful leap it batted the coat with its claws then batted it again but found no flesh and blood inside the cloth sharpe had slipped through the door turned to the steps and snatched up the pistol he turned back hoping to regain the safety of the cell before the tiger noticed him but his foot slipped on the lowest step and he fell backwards against the stone stairs the tiger heard him turned and went still the yellow eyes stared at sharpe sharpe gazed back then slowly thumbed the cock of the pistol the tiger heard the click and its tail lashed once the merciless eyes watched sharpe then very slowly the tiger crouched its tail swung back and forth once more dont shoot now mccandless called softly get close yes sir sharpe said he kept his eyes on the tigers eyes as he slowly slowly climbed to his feet and edged towards the beast the fear was like a mad wild thing inside him hakeswill was spitting encouragement but sharpe heard nothing and he saw nothing but the tigers eyes he wondered if he should attempt to duck back into the cell but guessed that the tiger would spring while he was still trying to open the door better to face the beast and shoot it in the open pit he decided he held the pistol at arms length keeping the muzzle aimed at a patch of black fur just beneath the animals eyes fifteen feet away twelve his boots grated on the stone floor how accurate was the pistol it was a pretty enough thing all ivory and silver but did it fire true and how tightly was the ball sized to the barrel even a gap between barrel and ball the width of a sheet of paper was enough to throw a bullet wide as it spat out of the muzzle even at twelve feet a pistol could miss a mansize target let alone a small patch of matted fur between a maneating tigers eyes kill the bugger sharpie hakeswill urged careful man mccandless hissed make sure of your shot careful now sharpe edged forward his eyes were still fixed on the tigers eyes he was willing the beast to stay still to receive its death gracefully ten feet the tiger was motionless just watching him sweat stung sharpes eyes and the weight of the pistol was making his hand tremble do it now he thought do it now pull the trigger put the bugger down and run like shit he blinked his eyes stinging with the sweat the tiger did not even blink eight feet he could smell the beast see its unsheathed claws on the stone see the glint in its eyes seven feet close enough he reckoned and he straightened his arm to line up the pistols rudimentary sights and the tiger sprang it came from the ground so fast that it was almost on top of sharpe before he even realized that the beast had moved he had a wild glimpse of huge claws stretched far out of their pads and of feral yellow teeth in a snarling mouth and he was unaware that he called aloud in panic he was unaware too that he had pulled the trigger not smoothly as he had planned but in a desperate panicked jerk then instinctively he dropped to the ground and curled tight so that the tigers leap would pass over him lawford gasped the echo of the pistol shot was hugely loud in the confines of the dungeon pit which suddenly reeked with the sulphurous smell of powder smoke hakeswill was crouching in a corner of his cell scarce daring to look while mccandless was mouthing a silent prayer sharpe was on the ground waiting for the agony of the claws to rip him apart but the tiger was dying the bullet had struck the back of the tigers mouth it was only a small bullet but the force of it was sufficient to pierce through the throats tissues and into the brain stem blood spattered the cell bars as the tigers graceful leap slumped into deaths collapse it had fallen at the foot of the steps but some terrible instinct of surging life still animated the beast and it tried to stand its paws scrabbled against stone and its head jerked up for a snarling second as the tail lashed then blood surged out of its mouth the head fell back and the beast went still there was silence the first flies came down to explore the blood spilling from the tigers mouth oh sweet suffering christ sharpe said picking himself up he was shaking jesus bloody wept mccandless did not reprove him the colonel knew a prayer when he heard one sharpe fetched his torn jacket pulled the cell door wide open then gingerly sidled past the dead tiger as though he feared the beast might come back to life mccandless and lawford followed him up the stone stairs what about me hakeswill called you cant leave me here it aint christian leave him mccandless ordered i was planning on it sir sharpe said he found his picklock again and reached for the padlock on the outer gate this lock was much simpler merely a crude onelever mechanism and it took only seconds to snap the ancient lock open where are we going lawford asked to ground man mccandless said the sudden freedom seemed to have lifted the colonels fever we must find somewhere to hide sharpe pushed the gate outwards then saw mary gazing at him from a doorway across the courtyard and he smiled then saw she was not smiling back but was instead looking terrified there were men with her and they too were unmoving with fear then sharpe saw why three jettis were crossing the courtyard towards the dungeon cage three monsters three men with bare oiled chests and muscles like tiger thews one carried a coiled whip while the other two were armed with hugely long spears with which they had planned to subdue the tiger before opening the prisoners cell sharpe swore he dropped his coat and picklock can you lock us in again mccandless asked those buggers are strong enough to tear the padlocks clean away sir we have to kill the bastards sharpe darted through the gate and ran to his right the jettis followed him but more slowly they were not fast men though their massive strength gave them an easy confidence as they spread out into a line to trap sharpe in a corner of the courtyard throw me a musket sharpe called to mary quick lass quick mary snatched a musket from one of kunwar singhs men and before the astonished man could protest she tossed it to sharpe he caught it held it at his waist but did not cock the weapon then he advanced on the middle jetti the man had seen that the musket was uncocked and he smiled anticipating an easy victory then slashed out his whip so that its coiled end wound round sharpes throat he tugged planning to pull sharpe off balance but sharpe was already running towards him cheating the whips tension and the jetti had never faced a man as quick as sharpe nor as lethal the jetti was still recovering from his surprise when the muzzle of the musket rammed into his adams apple with the force of a sledgehammer he choked his eyes widened then sharpe kicked him in the crotch and the huge man staggered and collapsed one big musclebound brute was down gasping desperately for breath but the long spears were turning towards sharpe who with the whip still trailing from his throat turned fast to his right he knocked the next jettfs spear aside with his musket barrel then reversed the weapon and charged the jetti abandoned his spear and reached for the musket but sharpe checked his rush so that the big mans hands closed on nothing and then sharpe swung the musket by its barrel so that its brassbound butt slammed into the mans temple with the sound of an axe biting into soft wood two of the bastards were down the soldiers on the inner ramparts battery were watching the fight but not interfering they were confused for kunwar singh was standing right beside the fight and doing nothing and his jewels made him appear a man of high authority and so they followed his example and did not try to intervene some of the watching soldiers were even cheering for though the jettis were admired they were also resented because they received privileges far above any ordinary soldiers expectations lawford had moved to help sharpe but his uncle held him back let him be willie mccandless said quietly hes doing the lords work and ive rarely seen it done better the third jetti lumbered at sharpe with his spear he advanced warily confused by the ease with which this foreign demon had downed his two companions sharpe smiled at the third jetti shouldered the musket pulled back the cock and fired the bullet drummed into ihejettfs chest making all his huge muscles shudder with the force of its impact the jetti slowed then tried to charge again but his knees gave way and he fell forward onto his face he twitched his hands scrabbled for an instant then he was still from the ramparts above the soldiers cheered sharpe uncoiled the whip from his neck picked up one of the clumsy spears and finished off the two jettis who still lived one had been stunned and the other was almost unable to breathe and both now had their throats cut from the windows of the low buildings around the courtyard men and women stared at sharpe in shock dont just stand there sharpe snarled at lawford sir he added hastily lawford and mccandless came through the gate while kunwar singh as if released from a spell suddenly hurried to meet them mary crossed to sharpe are you all right never better lass he said in truth he was shaking as he picked up his red coat and as kunwar singhs six men stared at him as though he was a devil come from nightmare sharpe wiped sweat from his eyes he was oblivious of most of what had just happened for he had fought as he had always fought fast and with a lethal skill but it was instinct that led him not reason and the fight had left him with a seething hate he wanted to slake that hate by killing more men and perhaps kunwar singhs soldiers picked up that ferocity for none of them dared move lawford crossed to sharpe we think the assault is about to come sharpe the lieutenant said and colonel mccandless is being taken to a place of safety hes insisted that we go with him the fellow in the jewels isnt happy about that but mccandless wont go without us and well done by the way sharpe glanced up into the lieutenants eyes tm not going with him sir im going to fight sharpe lawford reproved him theres a bloody great mine sir sharpe raised his voice angrily just waiting to kill our lads i aint letting that happen you can do what you bloody well like but im going to kill some more of these bastards you can come with me sir or stay with the colonel i dont care you lad this was to one of kunwar singhs uncomprehending soldiers give me some cartridges come on hurry sharpe crossed to the man pulled open his pouch and helped himself to a handful of cartridges that he shoved into a pocket kunwar singh made no move to stop him indeed everyone in the courtyard seemed to be stunned by the ferocity that had reduced three of the tippoos prized jettis to dead meat though the officer commanding the troops on the inner wall did now call down to demand to know what was happening kunwar singh shouted back that they were doing the tippoos bidding mccandless had overheard sharpe talking to lawford if i can help private the colonel said youre weak sir begging your pardon sir but mister lawford will help me lawford said nothing for a moment then nodded yes of course i will what will you do mccandless asked he spoke to sharpe not lawford blow the bloody mine sir blow it to kingdom come god bless you sharpe and keep you save your prayers for the bloody enemy sir sharpe said curtly he rammed a bullet home then plunged into an alleyway that led southwards he was loose in his enemys rear he was angry and he was ready to give the bastards a taste of hell on earth major general baird hauled a huge watch from his fob pocket sprang open the lid and stared at the hands one oclock on the fourth of may a saturday a drop of sweat landed on the watch crystal and he carefully wiped it away with a tassel of his red sash his mother had made the sash youll not let us down young davy she had said sternly giving him the strip of tasseeed silk and then saying no more as he had walked away to join the army the sash was over twenty years old now and it was frayed and threadbare but baird reckoned it would last him he would take it back to scotland one day it would be good he thought to go home and see the new century maybe the eighteen hundreds would bring a different world even a better one but he doubted that the new era would manage to dispense with soldiers till time ended baird suspected there would be uses for a man and his sword he took off his mildewed hat and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve almost time he peered between two sandbags that formed the forward lip of the trench the south cauvery rippled prettily between its flat boulders the paths across its bed marked with the little white flags on their bamboo sticks in a moment he would launch men across those paths then through the gap in the glacis and up that mound of stone brick mud and dust he counted eleven cannonballs stranded on the breach looking for all the world like plums stuck in a pudding three hundred yards of ground to cover one river to cross and one plum pudding to climb he could see men peering from between the citys battered crenellations flags flew there the bastards would have guns mounted crosswise to the breach and perhaps a mine buried in the rubble god preserve the forlorn hopes he thought though god was not usually merciful in such matters if colonel gent was right and there was a massive mine waiting for the attackers then the forlorn hopes would be slaughtered and then the main attack would have to assault the breach and climb its shoulders to where the enemy was massed on the outer ramparts so be it too late to worry now baird pushed through the waiting men to find sergeant graham graham would lead one of the two forlorn hopes and if he lived would be lieutenant graham by nightfall the sergeant was scooping a last ladleful of water from one of the barrels that had been placed in the trenches to slake the thirst of the waiting men not long now sergeant baird said whenever you say sir graham poured the water over his bare head then pulled on his shako he would go into the breach with a musket in one hand and a british flag in the other whenever the guns give their farewell volley sergeant baird clicked open the watch again and it seemed to him the hands had scarcely moved in six minutes i think if this is accurate he held the watch to his ear it usually loses a minute or two every day were ready sir graham said tm sure youre ready baird said but wait for my order of course sir baird looked at the volunteers a mix of british and sepoys they grinned back at him rogues he thought every last man jack of them but what splendid rogues brave as lions baird felt a pang of sentimentality for these men even for the sepoys like many soldiers the scotsman was an emotional man and he instinctively disliked those men like colonel wellesley who seemed passionless passion baird reckoned was what would take men across the river and up the breach damn scientific soldiering now the science of siege warfare had opened the city but only a screaming and insane passion would take men inside god be with you all boys he said to the forlorn hope and they grinned again like every man who would cross the river today none of them was encumbered with a pack they had all stripped off their stocks too they carried weapons and cartridges and nothing else and if they succeeded they would be rewarded with general harriss thanks and maybe a pittance of coins is there food in the city sir one of the volunteers asked plenty boys plenty baird like the rest of the army was on halfrations and some bibbi sir another man asked baird rolled his eyes running over with it lads and all of them just panting for you the place is fair crammed with bibbi even enough for us old generals they laughed general harris had given strict orders that the inhabitants were not to be molested but baird knew that the terrible savagery of an assault on a breach almost demanded that the mens appetites be satisfied afterwards he did not care so far as major general david baird was concerned the boys could play to their loins content so long as they first won he edged his way through the crush of men to a point midway between the two forlorn hopes the watch still ticked but again the minute hand seemed scarcely to have moved since he last looked at the face baird closed the lid pushed the watch into his fob then peered again at the city the undamaged parts of the wall glowed white in the sun it was with its towers and shining roofs and tall palms a beautiful place yet it was there that baird had spent close to four years as a prisoner of the tippoo he hated the place as he hated its ruler revenge had been a long time coming but it was here now he drew his claymore a brutal scottish blade that had none of the finesse of more modern swords yet baird at six feet four inches tall had little need of finesse he would carry his butchers blade into a breach of blood to pay back the tippoo for fortyfour months of hell in the batteries behind baird the gunners blew on their linstocks to keep the fire burning general harris pulled out his watch colonel arthur wellesley who would lead the second wave of attackers through the breach adjusted his cravat and thought of his responsibilities the bulk of his men were from the regiment de meuron a swiss battalion that had once fought for the dutch but which had put itself under the command of the east india company when the british had captured ceylon the men were mostly swiss but with a leavening from the german states and they were a sober steady battalion that wellesley planned to lead to the inner palace to protect its contents and its harem from the ravages of the attackers seringapatam might fall and the tippop might die but the important thing was to gain mysores friendship and wellesley was determined to make certain that no unnecessary atrocities soured its citizens new allegiance he adjusted the silvergilt gorget about his neck drew his sword an inch or two then let it fall back into its scabbard before momentarily closing his eyes to say a prayer beseeching gods protection on his men the forlorn hopes their muskets loaded and tipped with steel crouched in the trenches the officers watches ticked on the river ran gentle across its stones and the silent city waited coat off sharpe said to lawford instinctively lapsing back into the relationship that had existed between them when they had served in gudins battalion no point in showing a red coat till we have to sharpe explained turning his own coat inside out he did not put it back on but knotted its sleeves about his neck so that the clawtorn jacket hung down against his scarred and naked back the two men were crouched in a byre off the alley that led from the courtyard colonel mccandless had gone led away to appah raos house and sharpe and lawford were alone i dont even have a gun the lieutenant said nervously soon remedy that sharpe said confidently come on now sharpe led plunging into the intricate maze of small streets that surrounded the palace a white mans face was not so unusual as to attract attention in seringapatam for there were plenty of europeans serving the tippoo but even so sharpe did not fancy his chances in a red coat he did not fancy his chances much at all but he would be damned before he abandoned his fellow soldiers to the tippoos mine he hurried past a shuttered goldsmiths shop and half glimpsed deep in its shadowed entrance an armed man who was standing guard on the property stay here he told lawford then slung the musket on his shoulder and doubled back he pushed a wandering cow out of his way and ducked into the goldsmiths entrance how are you feeling today he said pleasantly to the man who speaking no english just frowned in confusion he was still frowning when sharpes left fist buried itself in his belly he grunted but then the right fist smacked him on the bridge of his nose and he was in no state to resist as sharpe stripped him of musket and cartridge box for good measure sharpe gave the man a tap on the skull with the butt end of the musket then went back to the street one musket sir filthy as hell but shell fire cartridges too lawford opened the muskets pan to check that it was loaded just what do you plan to do sharpe the lieutenant asked dont know sir wont know till we get there youre going to the mine aye sir therell be guards like as not and only two of us i can count sir sharpe grinned its reading i find hard but my letters are coming on arent they youre reading well lawford said probably the lieutenant thought as well as most sevenyearolds but it had still been gratifying to see the pleasure sharpe took from the process even if his only reading matter was a crumpled page of the revelation full of mysterious beasts with wings that covered their eyes ill get you some more interesting books when were out of here lawford promised id like that sir sharpe said then ran across a street junction the fear of an imminent assault had served to empty the streets of their usual crowds but the alleys were clogged with parked carts stray dogs barked as the two men hurried southwards but there were few people to remark their presence there sir theres our bloody answer sharpe said he had run from a street into a small square and now jerked back into the shadows lawford peered about the corner to see that the small open space was filled with handcarts and that the handcarts were piled with rockets waiting to take them up to the wall i dare say sharpe said got so many up there already they have to store the rest down here what we do sir is take one cart go down that next street and have a private guy fawkes day there are guards of course there are i mean on the rocket carts sharpe theyre nothing sharpe said scornfully if those fellows were any good theyd be up on the walls cant be nothing but maimed men and grandfathers rubbish all we have to do is shout at the buggers are you ready lawford looked into his companions face youre enjoying this arent you sharpe aye sir arent you tm scared as hell lawford admitted sharpe smiled you wont be when were through sir were going to be all right you just behave as though you owned the bloody place you officers are supposed to be good at that arent you so ill grab a cart and you shout at the rubbish tell them gudin sent us come on sir times wasting just walk out there as though we owned the place sharpe brazenly walked into the sunlight his musket slung on his shoulder and lawford followed him you wont tell anyone that i confessed to being scared the lieutenant asked of course not sir you think im not scared myself jesus i almost fouled my breeches when that bloody tiger jumped at me ive never seen a thing move so bloody fast but i wasnt going to show i was scared in front of bloody hakeswill hey you are you in charge sharpe shouted imperiously at a man who squatted beside one of the carts move your bloody self i want the cart the man sprang aside as sharpe jerked up the handles there must have been fifty rockets in the cart more than enough for sharpes purpose two other men shouted protests at sharpe but lawford waved them down colonel gudin sent us understand lawford said colonel gudin he sent us the lieutenant followed sharpe down the street leading south from the square those two men are coming after us he said nervously shout at the buggers sir youre an officer back lawford shouted to your duties go on now do as i say damn your eyes go he paused then gave a delighted chuckle good god sharpe it worked works with us sir should work with them sharpe said he turned a corner and saw the towering sculptures of the big hindu temple he recognized where he was now and he knew the alley leading to the mine was only a few yards away it would be filled with guards but sharpe now had a whole arsenal of his own we cant do anything if there isnt an attack lawford said i know that sir so what do we do if there isnt an assault hide sir where for gods sake lali will take us in sir you remember lali dont you sir lawford blushed at the memory of his introduction to seringapatams brothels you really believe shell hide us she thinks youre sweet sir sharpe grinned tve seen her a couple of times since that first night sir and she always asks after you i reckon you made a conquest there sir good god sharpe you wont tell anyone me sir sharpe pretended to be shocked not a word sir then very suddenly and far off muffled by distance so that it was thin and wavering a trumpet sounded and every gun in creation seemed to fire at once baird clambered up the trench wall climbed over the sandbags and turned to face his men now my brave fellows he shouted in his broad scottish accent waving his sword towards the city follow me and prove yourselves worthy of the name british soldiers the forlorn hopes were already on their way the moment baird had climbed out of the trench the seventysix men of the two hopes had scrambled over the lip and began running they splashed through the little cauvery then sprinted towards the larger river the air about them churned with noise every siege gun had fired at almost the same instant and the breach was a boiling mass of dust while the huge sound of the guns was echoing back from the walls the banners of britain streamed as the leading men ran into the south cauvery the first bullets plucked at the water throwing up small fountains but the forlorn hopes did not notice the firing they were screaming their challenge and racing each other to be first up the breach fire the tippoo shouted and the walls of the city were rimmed with flame and smoke as a thousand muskets poured lead down into the south cauvery and out towards the trenches rockets hissed off the walls their trails twisting madly as they tangled in the hot air the trumpet was still sounding the musketry of the defenders was unending as men simply dropped their empty guns snatched up loaded ones and fired into the smoke cloud that edged the city the sound of their guns was like a giant fire crackling the river was foaming with bullets and a handful of redcoats and sepoys were jerking and thrashing as they drowned or bled to death come on sergeant graham roared as he stumbled over the remains of the mud wall that had penned in the water behind the glacis a foot of muddy water still lay in the old ditch but graham ran through it as though he had wings a bullet plucked at the flag in his left hand come on you bastards he shouted he was on the lower slope of the breach now and his whole world was nothing but noise and smoke and whipsawing bullets it was a tiny place that world a hell of dust and fire above a rubble slope he could see no enemy for those above him were hidden by their own musket smoke but then the defenders on the inner wall who could stare straight down the throat of the breach in the outer wall saw the redcoats clambering up the ramp and opened fire a man behind graham collapsed backwards with blood gurgling from his throat another pitched forward with a shattered knee graham reached the breachs summit his real goal was the wall to his left but the summit of the breach felt like triumph enough and he rammed the flagstaff deep into the stones and dust lieutenant graham now he shouted exultingly and a bullet immediately snatched him off the summit and hurled him back towards his men it was just then that the tippoos own volunteers struck sixty men swarmed up from behind the wall with sabres and muskets to meet the two forlorn hopes on the crest of the rubble breach these were the tippoos best men his tigers the warriors of allah who had been promised a favoured place in paradise and they screamed with exultation as they attacked they fired a musket volley as they climbed then threw down the empty guns to attack the redcoats with bright curved swords musket barrels parried swords bayonets lunged and were cut aside men swore and killed swore and died some men fought with hands and boots they gouged and bit each other as they grappled hand to hand on the dusty summit one bengali sepoy snatched up a fallen sword and carved a way to the foot of the wall where it climbed up from the breach to the northern ramparts a mysorean volunteer sliced at him the sepoy instinctively parried then cut down through the mans brass helmet so violently that the blade was buried and trapped in his enemys skull the bengali left it there and so fevered by battle that he did not realize he was weaponless tried to scale the broken walls flank to attack the defenders waiting on the firestep above a musket shot from the top of the wall hurled him backwards and he slid dying and bleeding to lodge against the wounded graham baird was still west of the river his job was not to die with the forlorn hopes but to lead the main attack up the path they had cleared that main attack now formed itself into two columns of platoons forward baird shouted and led the twin columns towards the river the ground ahead was being pitted by bullets as if an invisible hail fell behind him the drummer boys were sounding the advance while the engineers laden with their fascines and ladders walked alongside the platoons rockets screamed above baird their trails stitching ropes of smoke above the river men struggled hand to hand in the breach and the walls of the city spat flame through the churning rill of smoke hell had come to seringapatam and baird hurried towards it jesus christ sharpe swore for he could hear the sudden sound of battle swelling just beyond the western walls men were dying there men were storming a breach and the tippoos mine waited for them its tons of powder cunningly crammed into a stone tunnel and poised to annihilate a whole brigade he stopped at a corner of the alley which led to the ancient gateway that had been filled with the explosives he peered round the corner and saw sergeant rothiere and two frenchmen from gudins battalion all three were standing beside a barrel staring up at the inner ramparts and around the europeans was a guard of a halfdozen jettis all armed with muskets and swords he ducked back and blew the priming out of his muskets pan only nine or ten of the bastards he told lawford so lets give them a headache the rockets were stacked nose first on the cart so that their long bamboo tails stuck out towards the carts handles sharpe went to the front of the cart seized the thin boards that were painted with gods and elephants and wrenched them off they came away easily their nails pulling out of the carts sides he beat off the last slivers of wood so that now there was no obstacle in front of the lethal cargo then he turned the cart so that the rockets tin cones were pointing towards the alley though he took care to make sure that the cart and its contents were still hidden from the men waiting beside the mines fuse lawford said nothing but just watched as sharpe tore the fuse paper from one of the rockets he twisted the paper into a spill then pushed it into the muskets empty lock cocked the gun and pulled the trigger the powderimpregnated paper immediately caught the spark and started burning sharpe dropped the musket and began lighting the fuses of the topmost row of rockets the paper in his hand burned fiercely but he managed to light eight of the weapons before he was forced to tear off another fuse and use it to light more it was difficult to reach between the rockets bamboo sticks but he lit another ten while the first few fuses were fizzing and smoking lawford seeing what sharpe was doing had taken the single page of the bible from his pocket and twisted it into a spill that he used to light still more of the missiles then the first rocket to be lit suddenly coughed and spat out a gout of smoke and sharpe immediately snatched up the carts handles and shoved it around the corner so that the missiles were pointing straight down the alley he crouched beside it sheltered from the men in the alley by the corner of the building and pulled his musket towards him he used the musket to raise the carts handles so that the vehicles bed and the rockets it contained were horizontal the first rocket shuddered then streaked away the second went an instant later then two more and suddenly the whole cart was shaking and jerking as the rockets seethed away a musket bullet hit the cart another flicked dust from the corner of the building but then there were no more shots just shouts of terror as the missiles screamed between the alleys close walls some of the rockets had solid shot in their nose cones others had small charges of black powder and those now began to explode a man screamed more rockets exploded the sound of their blasts cramming the alley with noise while the missiles fierce trails filled the small street with smoke and flame sharpe waited till the last lit rocket flamed off the cart nows the hard bit he warned lawford he replaced the priming in his musket with a pinch from a fresh cartridge then seized the handcart and pushed it in front of him down the alley at least thirty of the rockets had fired and the alley was now an inferno of boiling smoke amongst which a handful of live rockets still ricocheted or spun crazily while the carcasses of the spent weapons burned bright in the gloom sharpe charged into that chaos hoping that the halfloaded cart would serve as a shield if any man still lived in the alley lawford charged with him at least four men were still on their feet while another had found shelter in a deep doorway but they were all dazed by the violence of the rockets and half blinded by the thick smoke sharpe gave the cart a huge push to send it clattering towards them one of the jettis saw the cart dodged aside and charged at sharpe with a drawn sabre but lawford shot him with his musket taking the huge man in the throat as quickly and cleanly as if he had been a pheasant rising from a brake the cart struck two of the standing men and sent them reeling sharpe stamped on the head of one and kicked the other in the crotch he slammed the butt of the musket onto the back of a frenchmans skull then drove the weapons muzzle deep into a jettfs belly and as the man folded he rammed the barrel into his face the jetti screamed and staggered away his hands clutched tight to one eye lawford had seized a fallen sword and sliced it savagely across another jettt s neck and was so inspired and elated by battle that he did not even feel any revulsion when the mans blood gushed out to hiss in the burning remnants of a rocket sergeant rothiere was on the ground with one of his legs broken by the strike of a rocket but he cocked his musket and aimed the gun at lawford then the sergeant heard sharpe behind him and tried to swing the musket round sharpe was too close and too fast he felled rothiere with a huge swing of his gun he felt the butt break the sergeants skull the gun was still loaded so he reversed it and snarled a challenge as he peered through the choking smoke he could see no danger now just wounded men dead men and flickering rocket cases the mines trail a snaking length of quick fuse had somehow escaped the fire of the rockets and lay discarded beside the toppled barrel in which rothiere had been keeping a lit linstock sharpe moved towards the barrel then heard the click of a gun being cocked thats far enough sharpe it was colonel gudin who spoke he was behind sharpe the colonel had been waiting for the tippoos signal on the inner ramparts just beside the gatehouse but he had jumped down onto a rooftop and then into the alley and now he aimed his pistol at sharpe lawford sabre in hand was a halfdozen paces away too far to help gudin jerked the pistol put the musket down sharpe gudin spoke calmly sharpe had turned with the musket at his hip the colonel was only three or four paces away put your pistol down sir sharpe said a slight look of regret crossed the colonels face as he straightened his arm to take more careful aim sharpe fired as soon as he saw the small movement and though he had not aimed the musket but fired it from the hip his bullet struck the colonel high on his right shoulder so that gudins pistol arm flew into the air sorry sir sharpe said and then he ran to where one of the spent rockets still had weak flames burning from its exhaust he carried the flaming carcass to the end of the quick fuse and there paused to listen he could hear cannons firing and knew they must be the tippoos guns for no british artilleryman would dare fire now for fear of hitting the assaulting troops he could hear musket fire but he could not hear the massive deepthroated roar of men coming into the breach the forlorn hope alone must be fighting and that meant the space between the walls must still be clear of british soldiers he stooped to put the rockets feeble flames to the waiting fuse but lawford pushed his arm aside sharpe looked up at the lieutenant sir best to leave the mine alone i think sharpe our men might be too close sharpe still held the burning tube just you and me sir eh you and me sharpe lawford asked puzzled in five minutes sir when the tippoo wonders why his fireworks arent going off and he sends a dozen men to find out whats happening you and me were going to fight all those buggers off alone lawford hesitated i dont know he said uncertainly i do sir sharpe said and he pushed the burning rocket onto the fuse and immediately a quick and bitter fire began to fizzle and spark down the powderimpregnated rope gudin tried to stub it out with his foot but sharpe unceremoniously shoved the frenchman aside are you hurt bad sir he asked gudin broken shoulder sharpe gudin looked close to tears not because of his wound but because he had failed in his duty ive no doubt doctor venkatesh will mend it how did you escape killed a tiger sir and some more of those jetti buggers gudin smiled sadly the tippoo should have killed you when he had the chance we all make mistakes sir sharpe said as he watched the fire burn through the stone barricade that had been piled up in front of the ancient archways gates i reckon wed better get you into cover sir he said and he pulled an unwilling gudin into a doorway where lawford was already crouching the smoke was thinning from the alley a wounded jetti was crawling blindly against the farther wall another was vomiting and sergeant rothiere was groaning there was blood bubbling at the sergeants nostrils and the back of his head was black with gore i reckon youve just made sergeant sharpe lawford said sharpe smiled i reckon i have sir well done sergeant sharpe lawford held out a hand a good days work sharpe shook his officers hand but the days work aint done yet sir it isnt lawford asked for gods sake man what else are you planning but lawford never heard what sergeant sharpe answered for at that moment the mine blew chapter the tippoos engineers had done their work well not all the mines force was directed northwards but the greater part of it was and that part was devastating the explosion scoured the space between the inner and outer walls a space that should have been packed with british soldiers to sharpe peering round the doorway it at first looked as though the whole squat gatehouse disintegrated not into rubble and dust but into its constituent stones for the dressed granite blocks all jarred slightly apart as the ancient building bulged from the terrible pressure of the fire within dust sprang from every opened crevice as the big stones separated cleanly along their mortared joints then sharpe lost sight of the collapsing gatehouse because there was suddenly nothing but dust smoke flame and noise he jerked back into shelter and covered his head with his arms when the noise boomed past him just an instant after he had seen the dust whip past the doorway as the gasses escaped from the expanding fire the noise seemed to go on for ever first there was the swelling bang of the powder exploding then the grinding crash of stones cracking and tumbling and the whistle of shards whirling away across the city and then there was a ringing in sharpes ears and above the ringing but sounding as far away and as thin as the trumpet that had heralded the assault the screams of men caught by fire or blast or stone after that came the sound of a wind an unnatural wind that scoured thatch off houses threw down tiles and raised dust devils in streets a quarter of a mile away from the explosion the men on the walls nearest the gatehouse saw nothing unless it was the flash that ended their lives for the explosion plucked the tippoos defenders clean off the ramparts south of the breach the wall itself was undamaged even where it ran past the gatehouse for there the old outer archway was blown out like a bung and a monstrous jet of smoky flame jetted from the city wall to vent the explosives power safely beneath the ramparts but the squat tower over the old gateway fell it collapsed slowly sliding down into the space between the inner and outer walls scraps of brick and stone arched up and outwards splashing in the river just ahead of bairds advancing columns more scraps of stone rained down on the city the noise slowly faded the ringing in sharpes ears diminished until he could hear a man whimpering somewhere in the horror he peered out again and saw that the explosion had scoured the alley of dead and wounded men there was no sign of the handcart there was nothing except broken stone burning thatch and smears of blood north of the breach where the lick of flame and blast had been lessened by distance the defenders were dizzied by noise their banners of gold and scarlet and green silk whipped stiff in the blast as men crouched in embrasures or reeled like drunks before the hot wind the tippoos heroes who had volunteered to fight the forlorn hopes on the breach were killed almost to a man for they were on the inner side of the breach where nothing could save them while the survivors of the forlorn hopes thrust back by the first charge of the tippoos men had been shielded by the southern shoulder of the broken wall in the breach itself there was a vast veil of swirling dust a huge boiling pyre of smoke churned above the walls but the breach for a moment at least was undefended the tippoos men who should have been guarding the shoulders of the breach were either dead or so shocked as to be unable to respond while the men on the inner wall had ducked down as the terrible noise and heat and dust pounded about them most of them still crouched fearful of the strange silence that followed the explosion now boys now a man shouted on the breach and the survivors of the forlorn hopes climbed into the smoke then up the broken stonework of the walls they choked on the airborne dust and their red coats were whitened by it but they were men who had steeled themselves to the worst ordeal of war the storming of a breach and the steel was hard and cold in their souls so that they were scarcely aware of the horror of the last few seconds only of the need to climb the shoulders of the breach and start their killing those who went south found an empty wall while those who went north climbed to meet dazed men the redcoats and sepoys had expected no mercy in this assault and were prepared to show none and so they began their slaughter pigsticking time lads one corporal shouted he stabbed his bayonet into a wildeyed man and rid his blade of the bodys encumbrance by shaking the corpse over the inner ramparts edge his comrades stormed past him their blood whipped into rage by the fear of being the first men into the enemy citadel now up on the ramparts they killed in a frenzy to let their fear escape in a torrent of enemy blood baird had still been west of the river when the explosion occurred and he had felt a momentary pang of horror as the great blast blossomed in the city for a terrible second he thought the whole city all its houses and temples and palaces was about to disintegrate before his eyes but he had kept moving indeed he had quickened his pace so that he splashed into the south cauvery while the debris was still falling he waded the shallows as all around him the river foamed with falling stone and he shouted incomprehensibly desperate to take his heavy sword to the enemy that had once imprisoned him the dust obscuring the breach shifted as a snatch of wind caught and whirled it northwards and baird saw that his forlorn hopes were on the walls now he saw some red coats oddly whitened moving north then he glimpsed a rush of the enemy coming from the southern bastions to replace the defenders who had been scoured from the ramparts by the explosion those reinforcements were running past a great roiling greywhite plume of smoke amongst which pale flames licked the sky baird assumed the explosion had been the tippoos feared mine but his horror at its force turned to exultation as he realized that the blast had been premature and that instead of slaughtering his men it had opened the city to storm but he also recognized that the enemy was now waking from his nightmare and rushing men to face the attack and so baird hurried out of the river through the shattered glacis and up the breach that was now vividly slicked with great splashes of fresh blood he chose to turn southwards to help that forlorn hope face the rush of the tippoos reinforcements behind baird the twin columns of redcoats splashed through the river each column had three thousand men and their task was to encircle the city and so capture the whole ring of seringapatams walls and bastions and towers and gates but the tippoos men were recovering their wits now and the invading streams were at last being opposed muskets blasted down from ramparts concealed guns were unmasked and rockets streaked away from the parapets canister and round shot slashed down at the two columns the missiles exploding high gouts of water as they struck the river sepoys and redcoats fell some crawled to safety others were carried downstream while the least fortunate were trampled by the boots of the men crossing the river the leading troops of each column scrambled up the broken shoulders of the walls the engineers shoved ladders against those shoulders and still more men climbed their rungs to the ramparts and there the fight changed now on the narrow firestep of the outer wall the columns had to force their way forward but the tippoos men were firing volley after volley into the attackers ranks the most damaging fire came from the inner wall for there the tippoos men were protected by a parapet while the british and their indian allies had no such protection on the inner side of the captured outer wall men fired at them from their front and a torrent of fire came from their flank yet still they pushed on consumed by the blind rage of war the only way to survive horror was to win through and so they stepped over the dead to fire their muskets then crouched to reload while the ranks behind pushed on the wounded fell some of them tumbling down to the inner ditch while behind them in the foaming river the tails of the two columns hurried on towards the battle the breach had been taken but the city had not fallen yet the sepoys and the redcoats had taken a hundred yards of the outer wall on either side of the breach but the tippoos soldiers were fighting back hard and the tippoo himself led the defenders north of the breach the tippoo had cursed gudin for blowing the mine too early and thus wasting its terrible destructive power but now he tried to revive the defence by his personal example he stood in the front rank of his soldiers while behind him a succession of aides loaded jewelencrusted hunting rifles one by one the rifles were given to the tippoo who aimed and fired aimed and fired and redcoat after redcoat was struck down whenever an enemy tried to rush along the ramparts the tippoo would drop that man then pass the gun back take another step forward through the powder smoke and fire again musket balls hissed about him two of his aides were wounded and a score of soldiers fighting at the tippoos side were killed or maimed but the tippoos life seemed charmed he stepped in blood but none of it was his and it seemed as though he could not die but only kill and so he did coldbloodedly deliberately exultantly defending his city and his dream against the barbarians who had come to snatch his tiger throne the fight on the walls intensified as more men came to the threatened ramparts the men in red came from the river and the men in tiger stripes came from other parts of the city wall and both came to kill on top of the wall a narrow place scarce five paces wide lifted in the sky where the vultures flew scenting death sharpe scooped up three fallen muskets from the end of the alley where they had been blown by the explosion he checked that his new guns were undamaged loaded the two which were empty then went back to lawford you stay with the colonel sir he suggested and put your coat right side out lads will be here soon and when theyre here sir you might like to find lali lawford coloured lali look after her sir i promised the lass shed come to no harm you did lawford asked with a trace of indignation he was wondering just how well sharpe knew the girl then he decided it was better not to ask of course ill look after her lawford said still blushing then he noted that sharpe despite his own advice had still not donned his red coat where are you going the lieutenant asked got a job to do sir sharpe answered vaguely and sir can i thank you sir i couldnt have done any of this without you sharpe was not used to offering such heartfelt compliments and he spoke awkwardly youre a brave bugger sir you really are lawford felt absurdly pleased he knew he should have stopped sharpe from leaving for this was no time for a man to be roaming seringapatams streets but sharpe was already gone lawford turned his coat the right side out and pushed his arms through the sleeves gudin beside him waved away a fly and wondered why the dust and smoke did not keep the pests away what will they do with me lieutenant he asked lawford theyll treat you well sir im sure theyll probably send you back to france id like that gudin said and suddenly realized that was all he really did want your private sharpe he said sergeant sharpe now sir your sergeant sharpe then hes a good man lieutenant yes sir lawford said he is if he lives hell go far if he lives sir yes and if the army lets him live lawford thought look after him lieutenant gudin said an army isnt made of its officers you know though we officers like to think it is an army is no better than its men and when you find good men you must look after them thats an officers job yes sir lawford said dutifully the first fugitives from the walls were visible at the end of the alley now men in dustsmeared tiger tunics who staggered or limped away from the fighting the noise of that fight was the continuous staccato of musket fire shouts and screams and it could not be long before the first murderous attackers broke into the streets lawford wondered if he should have demanded gudins sword then worried about having allowed sharpe to go off on his own sharpe lived so far he had thought about putting on his red coat then decided there was no point in making himself conspicuous even though the coat was now so filthy that it hardly looked like a uniform any more and so he left the turned jacket knotted about his neck and with two muskets slung on each shoulder ran northwards through the city the crackle of muskets was constant but above that crisp sound he could also hear the roar of maddened men going into a brutal fight in a few minutes that fight would spread into the city and sharpe planned to use those minutes well he ran through the small square where the rocket carts were still parked and then hurried past the inner palace where a tigerstriped guard thinking that sharpe was a deserter from the tippoos european troops shouted a challenge at him but by the time the guard had cocked his musket sharpe had already disappeared into the labyrinth of alleys and yards that lay to the north of the palace he pushed through a crowd of fearful women passed the cheetah cages and so went back to the dungeons the bodies of the three jettis were crawling with flies and beyond them the outer gate of the dungeons still swung open sharpe ran through the gate and jumped down the stairs to where his tiger lay dead sharpie hakeswill came to the bars you came back lad i knew you would so whats happening lad no dont do that hakeswill had seen sharpe take a musket from his shoulder i like you boy always have i might have seemed a bit hard on you at times but only for your own good sharpie youre a good boy you are youre a proper soldier no sharpe had aimed the musket sharpe turned the muzzle away from hakeswill and aimed it at the padlock he did not want to waste time with the picklock so he simply held the musket against the ancient loop of the padlock and pulled the trigger the iron loop sheared and the lock fell from the hasp sharpe dragged the cell door open ive come to get you obadiah he said knew you would sharpie knew you would hakeswills face twitched knew you wouldnt leave your sergeant to rot so come on out sharpe said hakeswill hung back no hard feelings lad tm not a lad obadiah im a sergeant like you are ive got colonel wellesleys promise i have im a sergeant now just like you so you are so you are and so you should be hakeswills face twitched again i said as much to mister morris didnt i that sharpie i said hes a sergeant in the making if ever i did see one a good lad i told him got my eye on him sir thats what i told mister morris sharpe smiled so come on out here obadiah hakeswill backed all the way to the cells rear wall better to stay here sharpie he said you know what the lads are like when their bloods boiling might get hurt out there best to stay put a while let the lads settle it first eh sharpe crossed the cell in two strides and gripped hakeswills collar you come with me you bastard he said tugging the whimpering sergeant forward i should kill you here you scum but you dont deserve a soldiers death obadiah youre too rotten for a bullet no sharpie no hakeswill screamed as sharpe dragged him out of the cell across the tigers carcass and up the stone steps i aint done nothing to you nothing sharpe turned furiously on hakeswill you had me flogged you bastard and then you betrayed us i never did cross my heart and hope to die sharpie sharpe spun hakeswill up against the bars of the dungeons outer cage slamming him against the iron rods then punched the sergeant in the chest youre going to die obadiah i promise because you did betray us i didnt do nothing hakeswill said through his laboured breathing on my mothers dying breath sharpie i didnt the flogging yes i did do that to you and i was wrong he tried to fall to his knees but sharpe dragged him upright i didnt betray you sharpie i wouldnt do that to another englishman youll still be telling lies when you go dirough the gates of hell obadiah sharpe said as he grabbed the sergeants collar again now come on you bastard he pulled hakeswill through the dungeons outer gate across the courtyard and into the alley which led south towards the palace a squad of tigerstriped soldiers ran past the mouth of the alley going to the western walls but none took any notice of sharpe the guard on the northern palace gate did notice him and levelled his musket but sharpe snarled the magic words at the man gudin colonel gudin and such was the confidence in sharpes voice that the guard lowered the musket and stepped aside where are you taking me sharpie hakeswill panted youll find out two more guards were stationed at the inner courtyard gate and they too pointed their muskets but sharpe shouted at them and once again gudins name was a talisman sufficient to allay their suspicions besides sharpe had a redcoated prisoner and the two nervous guards mistook him for one of gudins men and so let him pass sharpe lifted the gates latch and dragged it open the six tigers already disturbed by the terrible noises that had been battering about the city leapt towards the opening gate and their six chains cracked taut hakeswill saw the animals and screamed no sharpie no mother sharpe dragged the struggling hakeswill into the courtyard you reckon you cant die obadiah i reckon different so when you get to hell you bastard tell them it was sergeant sharpe who sent you no sharpie no this last word was a yelp of despair as sharpe pulled hakeswill into the centre of the courtyard and there spun him around at arms length no the sergeant wailed as sharpe spun him faster then sharpe suddenly let go of hakeswills collar the sergeant was unbalanced and out of control he staggered and flailed his arms but nothing could stop his momentum no he screamed a last time as he fell and slid across the sand to where three tigers waited goodbye obadiah sharpe said you bastard i cannot die hakeswill screamed then his cry was cut off as a great yelloweyed beast growled above him theyve got an early supper sharpe told the bemused guards on the gate hope theyve got an appetite the guards not understanding a word grinned back sharpe took one look behind spat and walked away a debt he reckoned was properly paid now all he needed to do was hide till the redcoats came and then he saw the pearlhung palanquin and another debt came to mind for a time it seemed as if the tippoo could hold his city he fought like a tiger himself knowing that this blaze of violence beneath a smokeshrouded sun would decide his fate it would be the tiger throne or the grave he did not know what was happening on the southern stretch of the walls except that the distant fury of constant musket fire told him that fighting continued there he only knew that he and his men were taking a terrible toll of the attackers on the northern wall the tippoo had been forced slowly back by the sheer weight of numbers that poured onto the ramparts and that bloody retreat had driven him off the western ramparts back around the corner by the remnants of the northwestern bastion and so onto the long stretch of northern wall which faced towards the river cauvery but there his retreat had stopped a cushoon of infantry had been stationed in the sultan battery the largest bastion in the north wall and that garrison hurried along the walls to reinforce the tippoo who now possessed enough men to overwhelm the musketry of the attackers on the narrow northern firestep the tippoo still led the fight he was dressed in a white linen tunic and loose chintz drawers with a red silk sash about his waist he had jewelled armlets the great ruby glittered on the feathered plume of his helmet there were pearls and an emerald necklace at his throat and the goldhilted tiger sword at his side those gaudy stones made him a target for every redcoat and sepoy yet he insisted on staying in the very front rank where he could pour his rifle fire at the stalled attackers and his charms worked for though the bullets flicked close none hit him he was the tiger of mysore he could not die only kill the attackers suffered even worse damage from the men on the inner wall that wall had not been breached it had not even been attacked and more and more tigerstriped infantry hurried up its ramps to reinforce the defenders they fired across the inner ditch and their musket balls flayed at the crowded attackers and their cannon fire cleared whole stretches of the outer wall only the blinding powder smoke that hung between the walls protected the attackers who either endured the terrible flank fire or else crouched behind dismounted cannon and prayed that their ordeal would soon end they had captured the northwestern corner of the outer wall but it seemed to have gained them nothing but death for now it was the turn of the tippoos men to be the slaughterers baird heading south from the breach encountered similar resistance but baird was in no mood to be delayed he caught up and passed the survivors of the forlorn hope and shouting like a demon led a crazed charge past the ruined gatehouse where the remnants of the tippoos mine smoked like the pit of hell baird was a major general but he would gladly have given all the gold lace on his uniform for this one chance to fight like a common soldier this was revenge and the great claymore hacked into the tippoos men as baird bellowed his challenge that mingled fury with the agonized memories of his humiliation in this city he fought like a creature possessed stepping over the dead and slipping on their blood as he carried the battle down the walls his men howled with him they were caught up in bairds madness at this hour under the fire of the sun and emboldened by the arrack and rum they had drunk in their long wait in the trenches the redcoats and sepoys had become gods of war they gave death with impunity as they followed a warmaddened scotsman down an enemy wall that was sticky with blood baird would have his city or else he would die in its dust appah raos cushoons defended the southwestern corner of the city and appah rao watched appalled as the hugely tall scotsman hacked his way towards him he watched the torrent of redcoats swarming behind the giant and he heard their shouts and he watched their victims fall off the ramparts the brigade that defended that stretch of wall was being killed man by man and those that lived were giving way and some were running ratiier than face the horror and appah raos men were next for the slaughter but to die for what he wondered the city was gone and the tippoos dynasty was doomed appah rao knew his men were watching him waiting for the order that would hurl them into battle but instead the general turned to his secondincommand when were the men last paid he asked the officer frowned puzzled by the question but at last managed an answer three months at least sahib four i think tell them there will be a pay parade this afternoon sahib the secondincommand gaped up at appah rao the general raised his voice so that as many of his men as possible could hear him the pay is overdue so this afternoon we shall have a pay parade in the encampment men shouldnt fight without pay he ostentatiously sheathed his sword and walked calmly down from the ramparts here at the mysore gate there was no ditch between the inner and outer walls and rao airily strode through the inner gate for a second his men watched him then first in ones and twos and afterwards in a rush they followed one instant the wall was crammed with men the next it was emptying so that baird cutting his furious way through the last of the west walls guards suddenly saw that the city was his he howled again this time in victory his butchers sword was red with blood his right sleeve soaked with it a redcoat perhaps forgetting that the scotsman was a general slapped his back and baird hugged the man for pure joy the tippoo still fought and still thought he could win but on the northern wall just twenty yards beyond the northwest bastion a single crosswall joined the inner and outer ramparts the crosswall served as a buttress for the old outer wall and at one time it had been intended to thicken the buttressing crosswall then make the space it contained into an even larger bastion but the work had never been done and now the wall its coping just eight inches across offered itself as a perilously narrow bridge to the redcoats and sepoys who were trapped by the tippoos fire if they could cross that bridge they could assault the inner wall and scour its defenders from the deadly parapet one man tried to cross and was shot down he wailed as he fell into the ditch a moment later another man dashed across and reached halfway before a musket ball shattered his lower leg he dropped his own musket and fell onto the walls coping cursing as he tried to keep his balance then a second shot tipped him over the side for a second or two he managed to cling to the top of the wall shuddering as pain shook his body then he too dropped the tippoos men on the outer wall cheered and edged forward to drive the enemy away from the buttressing crosswall but a rush of sepoys checked their progress a new musket duel broke out indian against indian a torrent of fire in which the tippoo somehow survived like a charmed being the sepoys fired volley after volley came forward died and more men came to take their places the light company of the rings iath regiment followed the sepoys captain goodall their commander eyed the narrow buttress it led directly to the inner wall which was heavy with defenders but it was also a bridge to victory death or glory goodall shouted the cliche but it was a truism too at that moment and then he stepped out onto the narrow coping and fired his pistol into the lingering powder smoke that obscured the far end of the wall come on he called then ran along the top of the wall miraculously keeping his footing he jumped onto the inner walls parapet and slashed down with his sword a man fired up at him but goodalls sergeant coming hard behind had unceremoniously shoved his captain out of the way and goodall fell down onto the inner walls firestep and the bullet missed him the sergeant was next across the parapet then a line of screaming men followed as goodall fought his way eastwards the fire from the inner wall which had been gutting the attackers began to falter and suddenly a rush of redcoats who had been crouching for shelter from the inner walls musketry ran eastwards along the outer wall towards the tippoo others crossed the makeshift bridge to reinforce the laths light company the tippoo saw the enemy revive they were like a beast that had been wounded but not killed and the beast had life in it yet too much life and the tippoo understood that his nights troublesome dreams had been right after all the turbid oil pot had told the truth this day the city would fall and with it his throne and his palace and his seraglio with its six hundred women but the disaster did not mean the dynasty was dead there were great forts in mysores northern hills and if he could reach one of those fastnesses then he could still fight on against these devils in red who were stealing his capital the tippoo retreated fast and his bodyguard went with him they left other men to defend the outer wall while they ran past the sultan battery to the ramp which led down to the water gate and there at the foot of the ramp the palace chamberlains had thought to have his majestys palanquin ready with its bearers one of the chamberlains oblivious of the bullets hissing through the sky bowed low to the tippoo and invited his majesty to take his proper place on the plump silk cushions beneath the palanquins tigerstriped canopy the tippoo turned and glanced up at the walls to see what progress the attackers were making there was fighting on both walls now and the city was plainly doomed but the defenders were still resisting stubbornly the tippoo felt a pang at deserting them but swore he would avenge them yet he rejected the palanquin it was a slow vehicle in which to make a retreat while inside the city just on the other side of the inner wall he had stables filled with fine horses he would choose his swiftest horse snatch up some gold to pay those men who stayed loyal then flee through the citys unthreatened bangalore gate and from there turn north towards his great hill fortresses above the tippoo the citys last defenders retreated slowly the city was falling to the redcoats under a pall of smoke and god had willed it but god might yet permit the tippoo to fight another day and so rifle in hand he headed for the inner water gate the palanquin was carried by eight men two to each of its four long gilded handles when sharpe first saw it the clumsy vehicle was being hurried away from the palace by two robed chamberlains who lashed at the bearers with their tigerheaded staves for a second sharpe thought the tippoo must be inside the palanquin but then he saw that the side curtains were looped back and that the cushions inside were empty he followed he could sense a panic inside the city now it had been quiet until a few moments ago crouching like a beast not wanting to be noticed but now the city somehow sensed that its doom had come beggars huddled together for protection a woman cried in a shuttered house and the stray dogs yelped piteously small groups of the tippoos soldiers were fleeing in the streets their bare feet pattering on the dried mud as they ran towards the bangalore gate where no enemy threatened the sound of battle was still intense but the defence was fraying fast the chamberlains led the palanquin towards the water gate of the inner wall the gate lay close to the malodorous lake of sewage that so soured the air and some of the sewage denied proper drains by the hastily constructed inner wall had leaked into the water gate which was a bricklined tunnel fifty feet long piercing the inner wall an officer stood guard at its inner doors but as the palanquin approached he unbarred the big teak gates and dragged them open he shouted something as sharpe followed the clumsy vehicle into the low tunnel but sharpe just shouted colonel gudins name back and the officer was too confused to challenge him again instead once the palanquin and the european soldier had gone through the tunnel he closed the doors then glanced nervously up to where a mist of smoke betrayed the attackers progress on the wall above him sharpe paused inside the tunnel while the palanquin went on ahead the tunnels floor had sunk in places and the leaking sewage had gathered in those deep spots the place stank like an uncleaned barracks latrine the palanquins bearers stumbled as they splashed through the pools then the vehicle went into the sunlight beyond sharpe could see soldiers out there in the space between the walls the soldiers wore tiger stripes and were watching anxiously westwards he had followed the palanquin instinctively but now found himself in a bad place the tunnels thick teak doors were shut behind him the air was foul and choking and there was an enemy in front of him he crouched beside the damp wall trying to decide what he should do he had four muskets all but one loaded but his spare cartridges were in the pocket of his red coat which because it was still knotted round his neck was hard to reach he stood propped the muskets against the curved wall and pulled the jacket right side out and then shoved his arms into the tigertorn sleeves he was a redcoat again he loaded the one empty musket then crept towards the mouth of the tunnel and saw the tippoo he saw the small gaudy man come running down the ramp from the outer walls the tippoo surrounded by his bodyguard and aides stopped beside the palanquin sharpe saw the tippoo look back towards the fight then shake his head and immediately an aide broke away from the group and ran towards the tunnel where sharpe waited the tippoo gave one last glance westwards then followed bloody hell sharpe cursed the whole damned lot were coming for him and he backed down the tunnel cocked one of his muskets and dropped to one knee the aide ran into the tunnel shouting for the gate to be opened then he saw sharpe in the gloom and his shout died away he dragged a pistol from a green sash at his waist but too late sharpe fired the spark of the powder in the pan was unnaturally bright in the tunnel and the noise of the musket was magnified to a deafening crash but through the sudden smoke sharpe saw the aide flung backwards sharpe seized a second loaded musket and just at that instant the door opened behind him he turned snarling and the officer guarding the gate saw the red coat and without thinking just slammed the heavy nailstudded teak doors shut again sharpe heard the locking bar being dropped into place the tippoos bodyguard ran towards the tunnel sharpe fired his second musket he knew he could not fight them all so now his best chance of surviving was to deter them from coming into the tunnel itself then blessedly a roar of musketry announced that he had help and with the third musket in his hand he edged forward through the dense smoke to see that the tippoos bodyguard had been distracted by a new enemy some british troops had found steps down to the space between the walls and those troops were now attacking towards the water gate the bodyguard retreated from the new attackers unmasking the tunnels entrance and sharpe ran towards the daylight he crouched just inside the tunnel and saw that the tippoo had been caught in the open on one side was the palanquin with its dubious chance of a lumbering escape and on the other was the threatened water gate which led through the inner wall to his horses his bodyguard was firing and reloading firing and reloading while the tippoo seemed frozen with indecision a cheer sounded to sharpes left more muskets fired then suddenly there were two redcoats taking cover in the inner tunnel one saw sharpe and whirled round with a levelled musket whoa sharpe shouted tm on your bloody side the man wildeyed and with his right cheek pitted by powder burns from the lock of his musket turned back towards the enemy what regiment he called to sharpe havercakes you the old dozen the man fired and immediately sidled back to begin reloading the musketit stinks in here he said ramming a fresh bullet down his barrel more redcoats were occupying the sultan battery in the outer wall they had no british flag to show their conquest of the huge bastion and so they ran a red jacket up the flagpole the jacket had pale yellow facings showing that it came from the kings ith a suffolk regiment thats ours the man beside sharpe exulted then seemed to gurgle his eyes opened wide with astonishment he gave sharpe a puzzled almost reproachful look then slowly toppled backwards into one of the foetid puddles blood seeped onto his pale yellow facings up on the outer wall a mass of tigerstriped men charged to recapture the sultan battery and their courage gave new heart to the defenders between the walls who gave a cheer and fired a ragged volley at the redcoats edging towards the water gate the dying redcoat shuddered his companion fired then swore bastards he hesitated for a halfsecond then broke out of the tunnels shadow and sprinted back to the west back towards the rest of his comrades who had been advancing towards the tunnel the tippoo had made up his mind he would ignore the palanquin and try to reach his horse and so he had ordered his bodyguard to clear the tunnels entrance that bodyguard now charged screaming and sharpe knowing that he was trapped splashed back into the inner water gates lingering smoke he stopped halfway turned and blasted the musket towards the mouth of the tunnel where he could see the leading men of the tippoos bodyguard silhouetted against the daylight a man screamed sharpe had one loaded musket left musket balls thumped into the teak doors behind him he fired his last musket then reloaded with a practised but desperate haste he was waiting for men to appear in the dense smoke of the tunnel but none came sharpe knew he was going to die here but he was bloodily determined that he would die in company let the bastards come he was frightened and in his fear he was crooning a mad tuneless song without words but his fear did not stop him from loading a second musket still no one came to kill him and so he snatched up a third musket and bit the top off another cartridge the bodyguard had still not come into the tunnel sharpe in his fear had not heard the sound of battle growing at the end of the tunnel but now crouching and listening he became aware of the shouts and volleys the men of the ith were pouring musket fire into the tippoos bodyguard and those men were staying close to their monarch and returning the fire redcoats attacked from the west and more fired from me sultan battery the attempt to recapture the battery had failed and a mix of sepoys and redcoats were now forcing their way along the outer northern wall the ferocity of their fire had forced the tippoos bodyguard to crouch close about their monarch and sharpe had been given precious seconds in which to load his muskets he had three charged guns now three bullets and he wanted one of them for the heathen bastard who had poured salt on his back the bastard who wore a great ruby in his hat he again crept forward through the smoke willing the tippoo to come into the tunnel but the tippoo was once again fighting off the encroaching infidels allah had given him this last chance to kill redcoats and so he was taking the jewelled hunting rifles from his aides and calmly shooting at the men who had so nearly captured the inner water gate his aides were shouting at him to flee through the tunnel and find a horse but the tippoo had been granted this final moment of battle and it seemed to him that he could not miss with any of his shots and with each redcoat thrown back he felt a fierce joy then a new rush of sepoys and redcoats burst along the outer wall and those men came swarming down the ramp by the outer water gate to add their muskets to those threatening the tippoos shrinking bodyguard and as those new enemies appeared the tippoos charmed luck turned one bullet struck his thigh and another punched his left arm to leave a splash of blood bright on the white linen sleeve he staggered but kept his balance it seemed that not a man of his bodyguard was left unwounded but a score of them still lived and could walk in a moment though the enemy must triumph and the tippoo knew it was time to bid his city farewell we go he told his relieved aides and limped towards the tunnel his left arm was numb as though it had been hit by a giant hammer and there was a horrid pain in his left leg a shot crashed out of the water gates smoky gloom and the man leading the tippoos escape was snatched backwards from the tunnel entrance with blood misting up from his shattered skull against the bright sunlight that glowed at the end of the tunnel the fine droplets of blood looked like powdered rubies the man fell screamed and thrashed the tippoo stunned by the suddenness of the bodyguards unexpected death paused and behind him a terrible roar sounded as the assaulting redcoats closed in on the mouth of the tunnel the bodyguard turned back to face their attackers with fixed bayonets go your majesty a wounded aide thrust a rifle into the tippoos hands then dared to push his monarch into the tunnel the tippoo allowed himself to be pushed into the shadows but stopped close to the mouth of the tunnel and from there he stared into the vaporous darkness was an enemy there he could not see because of the smoke behind him were the harsh sounds of volleys and curses as his bodyguard died and as they died their bodies were making a terrible barricade that protected the tippoo but what waited in front of him he peered reluctant to go forward into the shitstinking gloom but then the aide snatched at the tippoos elbow and dragged him deeper into the darkness the few surviving bodyguards were defending the tunnel with bayonets stabbing at the crazed redcoats who tried to scramble across the bloody pile of corpses open the gate the aide shouted then he saw the shadow within the shadow at the end of the tunnel and he dropped to one knee and took aim with his jewelled rifle he fired and the golden tigermask doghead snapped forward onto the fiizzen sharpe threw himself to one side just as the gun fired heard the bullet snick the wall and ricochet into the teak door then he saw the aide pull a long pistol from his sash sharpe fired first the boom of his musket echoing in the tunnel like dooms diunder the ball hurled the aide back into a deep pool and suddenly there was only the tippoo and sharpe left sharpe stood and grinned at the tippoo bastard he said seeing the glint of light reflected from the ruby in his enemys helmet bastard he said again he had one loaded musket left the tippoo was holding a rifle sharpe stepped forward the tippoo recognized the hard bloody face in the gloom he smiled fate was most strange he thought why had he not killed this man when he had the chance behind him his bodyguard was dying and the victorious redcoats were plundering their bodies while in front of him was freedom and life except for one man to whom the tippoo had shown mercy just one man bastard sharpe said again he wanted to be close when he killed the tippoo close enough to make certain of the mans death behind the tippoo the bright daylight was dulled by the swirling gunsmoke where dying men gasped and victorious men looted mercy is gods prerogative not mans the tippoo said in persian and i should never have been merciful to you he aimed the rifle at sharpe and pulled the trigger but the gun did not fire in the panic of the last seconds the aide had handed the tippoo an unloaded rifle and the flint had sparked on an empty pan the tippoo smiled tossed the gun aside and unsheathed his tigerhilted sword there was blood on his arm and more on his chintz trousers but he showed no fear he even seemed to relish the moment how i do hate your cursed race he said calmly giving the sword a cut through the smoky air sharpe did not understand the tippoo any more than the tippoo understood sharpe youre a fat little bastard sharpe said and you took away my medal i wanted that its the only medal ive ever got the tippoo just smiled his helmet had been dipped in the fountain of life but it had not worked the magic had failed and only allah was left he waited for the snarling redcoat to shoot then a shout sounded in the mouth of the tunnel and the tippoo turned hoping that one last bodyguard would come to save him but no bodyguard appeared and the tippoo turned back to face sharpe i dreamed of death last night he said in persian as he limped forward and raised the curved blade to strike at the redcoat i dreamed of monkeys and monkeys mean death i should have killed you sharpe fired the bullet went higher than he intended he had thought to put it through the tippoos heart but instead it struck the king in the temple for a second the tippoo wavered his head had been whipped back by the bullets force and blood was soaking into his clothpadded helmet but he forced his head forward and stared into sharpes eyes the sword fell from his nerveless hand he seemed to smile a last time then he just slumped down the booming echo of the musket shot still battered sharpes ears so he was not aware that he was talking as he crouched beside the tippoo its your ruby i want sharpe said that bloody great ruby i wanted it from the very first moment i saw you colonel mccandless told me he did that its wealth that makes the world turn and i want my share the tippoo still lived but he could not move his expressionless eyes stared up at sharpe who thought the tippoo was dead but then the dying man blinked still here are you sharpe said he patted the tippoos bloodied cheek youre a brave fat bastard i will say that for you he wrenched the huge ruby off the bloodspattered feather plume then stripped the dying man of every jewel he could find he took the pearls from the tippoos neck twisted off an armlet bright with gems tugged off the diamond rings and unlatched the silverhung necklace of emeralds he pulled on the tippoos sash to see if the dagger with the great diamond called the moonstone in its hilt was there but the sash held nothing except the sword scabbard sharpe took that but left the tigerhilted sword he lifted the blade from a puddle of sewage and placed it in the tippoos hand you can keep your sword he told the dying man for you fought proper lake a proper soldier he stood up and then awkwardly because of his burden of jewels and because he was suddenly conscious of the dying kings gaze he saluted the tippoo take your blade to paradise he said and tell them you were killed by another proper soldier the tippoos eyes closed and he thought of the prayer that he had copied into his notebook that very morning i am full of sin the tippoo had written in his beautiful arabic script and thou allah art a sea of mercy where thy mercy is where is my sin that was a comfort there was no pain now not even in his leg and that was a comfort too but still he could not move it was like one of the dreams he copied each morning into his dreambook and he wondered at how peaceful everything suddenly seemed as peaceful as though he was floating on a gilded barge down a warm river beneath a blessed sun this must be the way to paradise he thought and he welcomed it paradise sharpe felt a pang of sorrow for the dying man he might have been a murderous enemy but he was a brave one the tippoo had fallen with his right arm trapped beneath his body and though sharpe suspected there was another jewelled armlet on that hidden sleeve he did not try to retrieve it the tippoo deserved to die in peace and besides sharpe was rich enough already for his pockets now held a kings ransom while a leather scabbard sewn with sapphires was hidden under his shabby coat and so he picked up one of his empty muskets and splashed through the tunnels bloody puddles towards the pile of dead that lay in the smoky sunlight a sergeant of the th startled by sharpes sudden appearance from the tunnel snatched up his bayonet then saw sharpes filthy red jacket and let the weapon fall anyone alive in there the sergeant asked just a fat little fellow dying sharpe said as he climbed over the barrier of the dead did he have any loot nothing sharpe said nothing worth the trouble place is full of shit too the sergeant frowned at sharpes unkempt dress and unpowdered hair what regiment are you not yours sharpe said curtly and walked away through the crowds of celebrating redcoats and sepoys not all were celebrating some were massacring trapped enemies the fight had been brief but nasty and now the winners took a bloody revenge on the far side of the inner wall colonel wellesley had brought his men into the streets and they now surrounded the palace to preserve it from plunder the smaller streets were not so fortunate and the first screams sounded as the sepoys and redcoats found their hungry way into the unprotected alleys the tippoos men those that still lived and had escaped their pursuers fled eastwards while the tippoo left alone in the tunnel lay dying sergeant richard sharpe slung the musket and walked around the base of the inner wall seeking a passage into the city he had only a few moments of freedom left before the army took him back into its iron grip but he had won his victory and he had pockets full of stones to prove it he went to find a drink next day it rained it was not the monsoon though it could have been for the rain fell with a ferocity that matched the fury of the previous days assault the pelting warm rain washed the blood off the citys walls and scoured the hot seasons filth out of its streets the cauvery swelled to fill its banks rising so high that no man could have crossed the river in front of the breach if the tippoos prayers had been answered and the british had waited one more day then the floods would have defeated them but there was no tippoo in seringapatam only the rajah who had been restored to his palace where he was surrounded by redcoated guards the palace which had been protected from the ravages of the assaulting troops was now being stripped bare by the victorious officers rain drummed on the greentiled roof and ran into the gutters and puddled in the courtyards as the redcoated officers sawed up the great tiger throne on which the tippoo had never sat they turned the handles of the tiger organ and laughed as the mechanical claw savaged the redcoats face they tugged down silk hangings they prised gems out of furniture and marvelled at the simple bare whitepainted room which had been the tippoos bedchamber the six tigers roaring because they had not been fed and because the rain fell so hard were shot the tippoos father the great hyder ali lay in a mausoleum east of the city and when the rainstorm had stopped and while the garden around the mausoleum was still steaming in the sudden sultry sunlight the tippoo was carried to rest beside his father british troops lined the route and reversed their arms as the cortege passed muffled drums beat a slow tattoo as the tippoo was borne on his sad last journey by his own defeated soldiers sharpe with three bright white stripes newly sewn onto his faded red sleeve waited close beside the domed mausoleum i do wonder who killed him colonel mccandless restored to a clean uniform and with his hair neatly cut had come to stand beside sharpe some lucky bastard sir a rich one by now no doubt the colonel said good for him sir sharpe said whoever he is hed only waste the plunder mccandless said severely hell fritter it on women and drink dont sound like a waste to me sir mccandless grimaced at the sergeants levity that ruby alone was worth ten years of a generals salary ten years a shame its vanished sir sharpe said guilelessly isnt it sharpe mccandless agreed but i hear you were at the water gate me sir no sir not me sir i stayed with mister lawford sir the colonel gave sharpe a fierce glance a sergeant of the old dozen reports he saw a wildlooking fellow come out of the water gate mccandlesss voice was accusing he says the man had a coat with scarlet facings and no buttons the colonel looked disapprovingly at sharpes red coat on which sharpe had somehow found time to stitch the sergeants stripes but not a single button the man seems very certain of what he saw he was probably confused by the battle sir lost his wits i wouldnt doubt so who put sergeant hakeswill in with the tigers mccandless demanded only the good lord knows sir and he aint saying the colonel scenting blasphemy frowned hakeswill says it was you he accused sharpe hakeswills mad sir and you cant trust a thing he says sharpe said and hakeswill was more than mad he was alive somehow he had escaped the tigers not one of the beasts had attacked the sergeant who had been discovered babbling in the courtyard crying for his mother and declaring his fondness for tigers he liked all pussy cats he had said to his rescuers i cant be killed he had shouted when the redcoats led him gently away touched by god i am he had claimed and then he had demanded that sharpe be arrested for attempted murder but lieutenant lawford had blushed and sworn that sergeant sharpe had never left his side after the mine was blown colonel gudin a prisoner now had confirmed the claim the two men had been discovered in one of the citys brothels where they had been protecting the women from the drunken rampaging victors hakeswills a lucky man mccandless said drily abandoning any further attempt to drag the truth from sharpe those tigers were maneaters but not devilcaters sir one whiff of hakeswih and they must have gone right off their feed he still swears it was you who threw him to the tigers mccandless said ive no doubt hell try to take his revenge ive no doubt either sir but ill be ready for him and next time sharpe thought he would make certain the bastard died mccandless turned as the slow funeral procession appeared at the end of the long road that led to the mausoleum opposite him behind an honour guard of the kings rd appah rao now in the rajahs service also watched the cortege approach appah raos family and household all lived mccandless had sat in appah raos courtyard a musket on his lap and turned back every redcoat or sepoy who had come to the house mary had thus survived unscathed and sharpe had heard that she would now marry her kunwar singh and he was glad for her he remembered the ruby he had once promised to give her and he smiled at the thought some other lass maybe the tippoos ruby was deep in his pouch hidden like all the other looted jewels the muffled drumbeat came nearer and the redcoated honour guard stiffened to attention mourners followed the coffin most of them the tippoos officers gudin was among them mccandless took off his cocked hat therell be more fighting to come sharpe the colonel said softly we have other enemies in india tm sure we have sir the colonel glanced at sharpe he saw a young man hard as flint and the restless anger in sharpes heart made him dangerous as flint and steel but there was also a kindness in sharpe mccandless had seen that kindness in the dungeons and mccandless believed it betrayed a soul that was well worth saving t may have uses for you if youre willing the colonel said sharpe seemed surprised i thought you were going home sir to scotland mccandless shrugged theres work undone here sharpe work undone and what will i ever do in scodand but dream of india i think i shall stay for a while and id be privileged to help you sir so i would sharpe said then he snatched off his shako as the coffin drew close his hair which he had still not clubbed or powdered fell loose across his scarlet collar as he stood to attention far away beyond the river rain fell on a green land but above sharpe the sun shone glistening its watery light on the mausoleums bulging white dome beneath which in a dark crypt under their silkdraped tombs the tippoos parents lay now the tippoo would join them the coffin was carried slowly past sharpe the men bearing the tippoo were dressed in his tigerstriped tunic while the coffin itself was draped with a great striped tiger pelt it was a mangy skin uncured and still bloody but the best that could be discovered in the chaos following the citys fall and down one flank there was a long ancient scar and sharpe seeing it smiled he had seen that scar before he had seen it every night that he was in the tippoos dungeons and now he saw it again scored into a tiger skin that covered a brave dead king it was sharpes tiger historical note the siege and fall of seringapatam in may ended decades of warfare between the remarkable muslim dynasty that ruled the state of mysore and the invading british the british under lord cornwallis had captured the city before in and at that time they decided to leave the tippoo on his throne but mutual antagonisms and the tippoos preference for a french alliance led to the final mysore war the aim of the war was simple to do what had not been done in unthrone the tippoo to which end the british concocted some very thin reasons to justify an invasion of mysore ignored the tippoos overtures for peace and so marched on seringapatam it was a brutally naked piece of aggression but successful for with the tippoos death the most formidable obstacle to british rule in southern india was removed and with it the increasingly slim chance that napoleon then at the head of a french army stranded in egypt would intervene in the subcontinent the novels description of the citys fall is mostly accurate two forlorn hopes one headed by the unfortunate sergeant graham led two columns of attacking troops across the wide south cauvery and up the breach and there the columns separated one going north about the citys outer ramparts and the other south major general david baird commanded the assault and he judging in the heat of battle that the resistance to the south was more formidable turned that way in fact the northern column encountered the stiffest opposition most probably caused by the tippoos own leadership many eyewitnesses from both sides testified to the tippoos personal bravery he was gaudily dressed and bright with gems but he insisted on fighting in the front rank of his men further difficulties were caused by the defenders firing from the inner walls sheltered firestep and it was not until captain goodall the commander of the th regiments light company had led his men across the buttressing crosswall and so began the capture of the inner ramparts that the defence collapsed the fight was short but exceptionally bloody causing casualties among the attackers and over from the tippoos troops i did take one great liberty with the historical facts of the assault there was no disused western gateway nor any mine either but the idea for the mine came from an enormous and spectacular explosion which occurred in the city two days before the assault it is believed that a british shell somehow ignited one of the tippoos magazines which then blew up i changed the nature of that explosion and delayed it by two days because fictional heroes must be given suitable employment there were a few french troops in seringapatam but nelsons victory at the nile had effectively ended any real chance of french intervention in india colonel gudin is a fictional character though someone very like him did lead a small french battalion in the battle others of the novels characters like colonel gent did exist major shee a somewhat intemperate and unfortunate irishman commanded the rd during the time wellesley served as one of harriss deputies and lieutenant fitzgerald brother of the knight of kerry was killed in the confused night attack on the sultanpetah tope probably by a bayonet thrust that setback was wellesleys only military defeat and it gave him a lifelong aversion to night actions major general baird did dislike wellesley and fiercely resented the fact that general harris appointed the younger man to be the governor of seringapatam after the siege although given bairds hatred of the indians the appointment was undoubtedly wise bairds jealousy lasted many years though in his later life the scotsman generously admitted that wellesley was his military superior by then of course arthur wellesley had become the first duke of wellington in only napoleon still regarded wellington with contempt dubbing him the sepoy general but the sepoy general still whipped napoleon the tippoo sultan of course existed his defeat was celebrated in britain where the tippoo was regarded as a peculiarly brutal and ferocious despot and for years afterwards despite many other momentous victories over much more formidable enemies the british still harked back to the tippoos defeat and death the event was celebrated in numerous prints it was turned into at least six stage plays and it occupied many books all tributes to the curious fascination the tippoo exercised over his erstwhile enemies yet his death despite being pictured and reenacted so many times was never fully explained because no one ever discovered who exactly killed him the tippoos body was found but his killer never came forward and it is presumed that this reticence was caused by the mans unwillingness to admit to ownership of the tippoos jewels where many of those jewels are today no one knows but much of the tippoos grandeur can still be seen the inner palace of seringapatam alas was demolished in the nineteenth century and all that remains of its splendour are a few ruined walls and some pillars which now support the canopy of sriringapatnas railway station but the summer palace the daria dowlat still exists the mural of the british defeat at pollilur was restored by wellesley who lived in this exquisite little palace while he governed mysore it is now a museum the tippoos mosque still stands there is another small palace in the city of bangalore and perhaps most moving of all the gumbaz the elegant mausoleum where the tippoo lies with his parents to this day his tomb is covered with a cloth patterned with tiger stripes the tippoo revered the tiger and used tiger motifs wherever he could his fabulous tiger throne existed but it was broken up at his death though large parts of it can still be seen notably in windsor castle his dreadful toy the tiger organ is now in londons victoria and albert museum the organ was sadly damaged during the blitz but it has been superbly restored though alas its voice is not what it was the tippoo did keep six tigers in his palace courtyard sriringapatnas outer wall still stands the town which has fewer inhabitants now than it did in is an attractive place and the site of the assault overlooking the south cauvery is marked by an obelisk that stands immediately to the north of the repaired breach just behind the breach and filling the whole northwestern corner of the defences is an enormous earthen bastion all that remains of the inner wall the rest of the inner wall has disappeared completely probably demolished by wellesley shortly after the siege later during the high noon of the raj various sites were identified in sriringapatna as historically significant locations but i believe the absence of the inner wall caused some confusion modern visitors to sriringapatna will discover plaques or memorials displayed at the tippoos dungeons at the water gate where he was supposedly killed and much farther east at the place where his body was found but of the three i suspect only the last is accurate the socalled dungeons are beneath the sultan battery and while it is quite possible they were used as cells in the and thus the place where baird spent his uncomfortable fortyfour months they were not so employed in by then the inner wall had been built and it is much more likely that the dungeons were thereafter employed as a magazine the tippoos surviving prisoners all attested that they were held inside the inner wall during the siege so that is where i placed sharpe lawford mccandless and hakeswill a plaque marks the water gate through the outer wall as the site of the tippoos death but again this seems wrong the evidence of mysorean survivors some of whom were close to the tippoo at the end clearly states that the tippoo was trying to get inside the city when he was killed we know he had been fighting on the outer wall and that when he broke off that fight he came down to the space between the walls and there the story becomes muddled british sources claim he tried to escape the city through the outer walls water gate but the indian testimonies all agree that he tried to go through the inner walls water gate into the city itself that second water gate has since vanished but i suspect it was there that he died and not at the existing gate it might seem logical that he should have attempted to flee the city but the remaining water gate led and still leads to the flooded ditch inside the glacis and even if he had negotiated those obstacles he would only have reached the southern bank of the cauvery which was under the guns of the british forces north of the river by cutting through the city he could have reached he bangalore gate which offered a much greater chance of successful escape indeed after the tippoos death or perhaps while he was still dying some of his loyal retainers found him placed him in the palanquin and carried him eastwards presumably in an attempt to reach the bangalore gate they were intercepted the palanquin was overturned and the tippoos body lay undiscovered for several hours it seems a pity to abandon the present water gate as the place where the tippoo was shot for its gloomy dank tunnel has a certain eerie drama but doubtless the matching gate in the inner wall was equally atmospheric the tippoos body was treated with honour and next day as the novel describes he was buried beside his parents in the gumbaz mausoleum wellesley meanwhile stamped out the looting in the city but what the common soldier could not take the senior officers happily plundered for themselves the east india companys prize agents tallied the tippoos treasures at a value of two million pounds and half of that fabulous fortune was declared to be prize money so that many senior officers became rich men through that single days work most of the treasures returned to britain where they remain some on public view but many still in private hands today the tippoo is a hero to many indians who regard him as a protoindependence fighter this seems a perverse judgement most of the tippoos enemies were other indian states though admittedly his fiercest fights were against the british but he could never entirely rely on his hindu subjects no one is certain that he was betrayed on the day of his death but it seems more than likely that several hindu officers like the fictional appah rao were deliberately lukewarm in their support the tippoos muslim religion and his preference for the persian language mark him as being outside the mainstream of modern indian tradition which is perhaps why i was assured by one educated indian that the tippoo had in truth been a hindu he was not and no amount of wishful thinking can make him into a more acceptably indian hero nor does his story need embellishment for he was a hero anyway even if he never did fight for indian independence he fought for mysorean domination over india which was a quite different thing i would like to thank elizabeth cartmalefreedman who ransacked the files of londons india house and did much other research for sharpes tiger and for all the useful things she discovered and which i left out i apologize i must also thank my agent toby eady who went above and beyond the call of duty by accompanying me to sriringapatna research has rarely been more enjoyable as usual when writing sharpe i owe gratitude to lady elizabeth longford for her superb book wellington the tears of the sword and to the late jac weller for his indispensable wellington in india sriringapatna is still dominated by the tippoos memory he was an efficient ruler whom indians revere and the british consider a callous tyrant that tyrannical reputation was caused above all by his execution of thirteen british prisoners before the assault it is unlikely that the executions took place at the summer palace but they were carried out by the tippoos jettis who did kill in the manner described in the novel those murders are reprehensible yet they should not blind us to the tippoos virtues he was a very brave man a considerable soldier a talented administrator and an enlightened ruler and he makes a worthy foe for young richard sharpe who still has a long road to march under his cold but very clever sepoy general sharpes triumph bernard cornwell the magnificent new novel in the bestselling series available in hardback from harper collins india it is four years since richard sharpe earned his sergeants stripes at the siege of seringapatam and four years in which sharpe seems to have discovered the easiest billet in the british army but that comfort is rudely shattered when he witnesses a murderous act of treachery by an english officer who has defected from the east india company to join the mercenary army of the mahratta confederation commanded by the flamboyant hanoverian anthony pohlmann sharpe is ordered to join the hunt for the renegade englishman a hunt that will take him deep into the enemys territory where he will face temptations more subtle than he has ever dreamed of and behind him relentlessly stalking him comes his worst enemy the baleful twitching sergeant obadiah hakeswill who is determined to break sharpe once and for all the paths of treachery all lead to the small village of assaye where sir arthur wellesley with a tiny british army faces the mahratta horde outnumbered and outgunned wellesley decides to fight and sergeant richard sharpe is plunged into the white heat of a battle that will make wellesleys reputation it will make sharpes name too but only if he can survive the carnage and killing frenzy for it is at assaye that he at last realizes his ambition and has a chance to seize it
