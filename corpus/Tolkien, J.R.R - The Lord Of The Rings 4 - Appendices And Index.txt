following appendices especially a to d see the note at the end of the prologue the section a iii durins folk was probably derived from gimli the dwarf who maintained his friendship with peregrin and meriadoc and met them again many times in gondor and rohan the legends histories and lore to be found in the sources are very extensive only selections from them in most places much abridged are here presented their principal purpose is to illustrate the war of the ring and its origins and to fill up some of the gaps in the main story the ancient legends of the first age in which bilbos chief interest lay are very briefly referred to since they concern the ancestry of elrond and the nъmenorean kings and chieftains actual extracts from longer annals and tales are placed within quotation marks insertions of later date are enclosed in brackets notes within quotation marks are found in the sources others are editorial the dates given are those of the third age unless they are marked sa or fa the third age was held to have ended when the three rings passed away in september but for the purposes of records in gondor fai began on march on the equation of the dating of gondor and shire reckoning see vols i and iii in lists the dates following the names of kings and rulers are the dates of their deaths if only one date is giventhe sign indicates a premature death in battle or otherwise though an annal of the event is not always included i the numenorean kings nъmenor fлanor was the greatest of the eldar in arts and lore but also the proudest and most selfwilled he wrought the three jewels the silmarilli and filled them with the radiance of the two trees telperion and laurelin that gave light to the land of the valar the jewels were coveted by morgoth the enemy who stole them and after destroying the trees took them to middleearth and guarded them in his great fortress of thangorodrim against the will of the valar fлanor forsook the blessed realm and went in exile to middleearth leading with him a great part of his people for in his pride he purposed to recover the jewels from morgoth by force thereafter followed the hopeless war of the eldar and the edain against thangorodrim in which they were at last utterly defeated the edain were three peoples of men who coming first to the west of middleearth and the shores of the great sea became allies of the eldar against the enemy there were three unions of the eldar and the edain lъthien and beren idril and tuor arwen and aragorn by the last the longsundered branches of the halfelven were reunited and their line was restored lъthien tinъviel was the daughter of king thingol greycloak of doriath in the first age but her mother was melian of the people of the valar beren was the son of barahir of the first house of the edain together they wrested a silmaril from the iron crown of morgoth lъthien became mortal and was lost to elvenkind dior was her son elwing was his daughter and had in her keeping the silmaril idril celebrindal was the daughter of turgon king of the hidden city of gondolin tuor was the son of huor of the house of hador the third house of the edain and the most renowned in the wars with morgoth eдrendil the mariner was their son eдrendil wedded elwing and with the power of the silmaril passed the shadows and came to the uttermost west and speaking as ambassador of both elves and men obtained the help by which morgoth was overthrown eдrendil was not permitted to return to mortal lands and his ship bearing the silmaril was set to sail in the heavens as a star and a sign of hope to the dwellers in middleearth oppressed by the great enemy of his servants the silmarilli alone preserved the ancient light of the two trees of valinor before morgoth poisoned them but the other two were lost at the end of the firth age of these things the full tale and much else concerning elves and men is told in the silmarillion the sons of eдrendil were elros and elrond the peredhil or halfelven in them alone the line of the heroic chieftains of the edain in the first age was preserved and after the fall of gilgalad the lineage of the highelven kings was also in middleearth only represented by their descendants at the end of the first age the valar gave to the halfelven an irrevocable choice to which kindred they would belong elrond chose to be of elvenkind and became a master of wisdom to him therefore was granted the same grace as to those of the high elves that still lingered in middleearth that when weary at last of the mortal lands they could take ship from the grey havens and pass into the uttermost west and this grace continued after the change of the world but to the children of elrond a choice was also appointed to pass with him from the circles of the world or if they remained to become mortal and die in middleearth for elrond therefore all chances of the war of the ring were fraught with sorrow elros chose to be of mankind and remain with the edain bet a great lifespan was granted to him many times that of lesser men as a reward for their sufferings in the cause against morgoth the valar the guardians of the world granted to the edain a land to dwell in removed from the dangers of middleearth most of them therefore set sail over sea and guided by the star of eдrendil came to the great isle of elenna westernmost of all mortal lands there they founded the realm of nъmenor there was a tall mountain in the midst of the land the meneltarma and from its summit the farsighted could descry the white tower of the haven of the eldar in eressлa thence the eldar came to the edain and enriched them with knowledge and many gifts but one command had been laid upon the nъmenoreans the ban of the valar they were forbidden to sail west out of sight of their own shores or to attempt to set foot on the undying lands for though a long span of life had been granted to them in the beginning thrice that of lesser men they must remain mortal since the valar were not permitted to take from them the gift of men elros was the first king of nъmenor and was afterwards known by the highelven name tarminyatur his descendants were longlived but mortal later when they became powerful they begrudged the choice of their forefather desiring the immortality within the life of the world that was the fate of the eldar and murmuring against the ban in this way began their rebellion which under the evil teaching of sauron brought about the downfall of nъmenor and the ruin of the ancient world as is told in the akallabкth these are the names of the kings and queens of nъmenor elros tarminyatur vardamir taramandil tarelendil tarmeneldur taraldarion tarancalimл taranбrion tarsъrion tartelperiлn tarminastir tarciryatan taratanamir the great tarancalimon tartelemmaitл tarvanimeldл taralcarin tarcalmacil after calmacil the kings took the sceptre in names of the nъmenorean tongue aradыnakhфr arzimrathфn arsakalthфr argimilzфr arinziladыn inziladыn repented of the ways of the kings and changed his name to tarpalantir the farsighted his daughter should have been the fourth queen tarmнriel but the kings nephew usurped the sceptre and became arpharazфn the golden last king of the nъmenoreans in the days of tarelendil the first snips of the nъmenoreans came back to middleearth his elder child was a daughter silmariлn her son was valandil first of the lords of andъniл in the west of the land renowned for their friendship with the eldar from him were descended amandil the last lord and his son elendil the tall the sixth king left only one child a daughter she became the first queen for it was then made a law of the royal house that the eldest child of the king whether man or woman should receive the sceptre the realm of nъmenor endured to the end of the second age and increased ever in power and splendour and until half the age had passed the nъmenoreans grew also in wisdom and joy the first sign of the shadow that was to fall upon them appeared in the days of tarminastir eleventh king he it was that sent a great force to the aid of gilgalad he loved the eldar but envied them the nъmenoreans had now become great mariners exploring all the seas eastward and they began to yearn for the west and the forbidden waters and the more joyful was their life the more they began to long for the immortality of the eldar moreover after minastir the kings became greedy of wealth and power at first the nъmenoreans had come to middleearth as teachers and friends of lesser men afflicted by sauron but now their havens became fortresses holding wide coasttends in subjection atanamir and his successors levied heavy tribute and the ships of the nъmenoreans returned laden with spoil it was taratanamir who first spoke openly against the ban and declared that the life of die eldar was his by right thus the shadow deepened and the thought of death darkened the hearts of the people then the nъmenoreans became divided on the one hand were the kings and those who followed them and were estranged from the eldar and the valar on the other were the few who called themselves the faithful they lived mostly in the west of the land the kings and their follower little by little abandoned the use of the eldarin tongues and at last the twentieth king took his royal name in nъmenorean form calling himself aradыnakhфr lord of the west this seemed illomened to the faithful for hitherto they had given that title only to one of the valar or to the elder king himself and indeed aradыnakhфr began to persecute the faithful and punished those who used the elventongues openly and the eldar came no more to nъmenor the power and wealth of the nъmenoreans nonetheless continued to increase but their years lessened as their fear of death grew and their joy departed tarpalantir attempted to amend the evil but it was too late and there was rebellion and strife in nъmenor when he died his nephew leader of the rebellion seized the sceptre and became king arpharazфn arpharazфn the golden was the proudest and most powerful of all the kings and no less than the kingship of the world was his desire he resolved to challenge sauron the great for the supremacy in middleearth and at length he himself set sail with a great navy and he landed at umbar so great was the might and splendour of the nъmenoreans that saurons own servants deserted him and sauron humbled himself doing homage and craving pardon then arpharazфn in the folly of his pride carried him back as a prisoner to nъmenor it was not long before he had bewitched the king and was master of his counsel and soon he had tamed the hearts of all the nъmenoreans except the remnant of the faithful back towards the darkness and sauron lied to the king declaring that everlasting life would be his who possessed the undying lands and that the ban was imposed only to prevent the kings of men from surpassing the valar but great kings take what is their right be said at length arpharazфn listened to this counsel for he felt the waning of his days and was besotted by the fear of death he prepared then the greatest armament that the world bad seen and when all was ready he sounded his trumpets and set sail and he broke the ban of the valar going up with war to wrest everlasting life from the lords of the west but when arpharazфn set foot upon the shores of aman the blessed the valar laid down their guardianship and called upon the one and the world was changed nъmenor was thrown down and swallowed in the sea and the undying lands were removed for ever from the circles of the world so ended the glory of nъmenor the last leaders of the faithful elendil and his sons escaped from the downfall with nine ships bearing a seedling of nimloth and the seven seeingstones and they were borne on the wings of a great storm and cast up on the shores of middleearth there they established in the northwest the nъmenorean realms in exile arnor and gondor elendil was the high king and dwelt in the north at annъminas and the rule in the south was committed to his sons isildur and anбrion they founded there osgiliath between minas ithil and minas anor not far from the confines of mordor for this good at least they believed lad come out of ruin that sauron also had perished but it was not so sauron was indeed caught in the wreck of nъmenor so that the bodily form in which he long had walked perished but he fled back to middleearth a spirit of hatred borne upon the dark wind he was unable ever again to assume a form that seemed fair to men but became black and hideous and his power thereafter was through terror alone he reentered mordor and hid there for a time in silence but his anger was great when he learned that elendil whom be most hated had escaped him and was now ordering a realm upon his borders therefore after a time he made war upon the exiles before they should take root orodruin burst once more into flame and was named anew in gondor amon amarth mount doom but sauron struck too soon before his own power was rebuilt whereas the power of gilgalad had increased in his absence and in the last alliance that was made against him sauron was overthrown and the one ring was taken from him so ended the second age the realms in exile the northern lineheirs of isildur arnor elendil sa isildur

was of old the name of all the lands between the misty mountains and the blue in the south it was bounded by the greyflood and the glanduin that flows into it above tharbad at its greatest arnor included all eriador except the regions beyond the lune and the lands east of greyflood and loudwater in which lay rivendell and hollin beyond the lune was elvish country green and quiet where no men went but dwarves dwelt and still dwell in the east side of the blue mountains especially in those parts south of the gulf of lune where they have mines that are still in use for this reason they were accustomed to pass east along the great road as they had done for long years before we came to the shire at the grey havens dwelt cнrdan the shipwright and some say he dwells there still until the last ship sets sail into the west in the days of the kings most of the high elves that still lingered in middleearth dwelt with cнrdan or in the seaward lands of lindon if any now remain they are few the northkingdom and the dъnedain after elendil and isildur there were eight high kings of arnor after eдrendur owing to dissensions among his sons their realm was divided into three arthedain rhudaur and cardolan arthedain was in the northwest and included the land between brandywine and lune and also the land north of the great road as far as the weather hills rhudaur was in the northeast and lay between the ettenmoors the weather hills and the misty mountains but included also the angle between the hoarwell and the loudwater cardolan was in the south its bounds being the brandywine the greyflood and the great road in arthedain the line of isildur was maintained and endured but the line soon perished in cardolan and rhudaur there was often strife between the kingdoms which hastened the waning of the dъnedain the chief matter of debate was the possession of the weather hills and the land westward towards bree both rhudaur and cardolan desired to possess amon sыl which stood on the borders of their realms for the tower of amon sыl held the chief palantнr of the north and the other two were both in the keeping of arthedain it was in the beginning of the reign of malvegil of arthedain that evil came to arnor for at that time the realm of angmar arose in the north beyond the ettenmoors its lands lay on both sides of the mountains and there were gathered many evil men and orcs and other fell creatures in the days of argeleb son of malvegil since no descendants of isildur remained in the other kingdoms the kings of arthedain again claimed the lordship of all arnor the claim was resisted by rhudaur there the dъnedain were few and power had been seized by an evil lord of the hillmen who was in secret league with angmar argeleb therefore fortified the weather hills but he was slain in battle with rhudaur and angmar arveleg son of argeleb with the help of cardolan and lindon drove back his enemies from the hills and for many years arthedain and cardolan held in force a frontier along the weather hills the great road and the lower hoarwell it is said that at this time rivendell was besieged a great host came out of angmar in and crossing the river entered cardolan and surrounded weathertop the dъnedain were defeated and arveleg was slain the tower of amon sыl was burned and razed but the palantнr was saved and carried back in retreat to fornost rhudaur was occupied by evil men subject to angmar and the dъnedain that remained there were slain or fled west cardolan was ravaged araphor son of arveleg was not yet fullgrown but he was valiant and with aid from cнrdan he repelled the enemy from fornost and the north downs a remnant of the faithful among the dъnedain of cardolan also held out in tyrn gorthad or took refuge in the forest behind it is said that angmar was for a time subdued by the elvenfolk coming from lindon and from rivendell for elrond brought help over the mountains out of lуrien it was at this time that the stoors that had dwelt in the angle fled west and south because of the wars and the dread of angmar and because the land and clime of eriador especially in the east worsened and became unfriendly some returned to wilderland and dwelt beside the gladden becoming a riverside people of fishers in the days of argeleb ii the plague came into eriador from the southeast and most of the people of cardolan perished especially in minhiriath the hobbits and all other peoples suffered greatly but the plague lessened as it passed northwards and the northern parts of arthedain were little affected it was at this time that an end came of the dъnedain of cardolan and evil spirits out of angmar and rhudaur entered into the deserted mounds and dwelt there it is said that the mounds of tyrn gorthad as the barrowdowns were called of old are very ancient and that many were built in the days of the old world of the first age by the forefathers of the edain before they crossed the blue mountains into beleriand of which lindon is all that now remains those hills were therefore revered by the dъnedain after their return and there many of their lords and kings were buried in the power of angmar arose again and the witchking came down upon arthedain before winter was ended he captured fornost and drove most of the remaining dъnedain over the lune among them were the sons of the king but king arvedui held out upon the north downs until the last and then fled north with some of his guard and they escaped by the swiftness of their horses for a while arvedui hid in the tunnels of the old dwarfmines near the far end of the mountains but he was driven at last by hunger to seek the help of the lossoth the snowmen of forochel some of these he found in camp by the seashore but they did not help the king willingly for he had nothing to offer them save a few jewels which they did cat value and they were afraid of the witchking who could make frost or thaw at his will but partly out of pity for the gaunt king and his men and partly out of fear of their weapons they gave them a little food and built for them snowhuts there arvedui was forced to wait hoping for help from the south for his horses had perished when cнrdan heard from aranarth son of arvedui of the kings flight to the north he at once sent a ship to forochel to seek for him the ship came there at last after many days because of contrary winds and the mariners saw from afar the little fire of driftwood which the lost men contrived to keep alight but the winter was long in loosing its grip that year and though it was then march the ice was only beginning to break and lay far out from the shore when the snowmen saw the ship they were amazed and afraid for they had seen no such ship on the sea within their memories but they had become now more friendly and they drew the king and those that survived of his company out over the ice in their sliding carts as for as they dared in this way a boat from the ship was able to reach them but the snowmen were uneasy for they said that they smelled danger in the wind and the chief of the lossoth said to arvedui do not mount on this seamonster if they have them let the seamen bring us food and other things that we need and you may stay here till the witchking goes home for in summer his power wanes but now his breath is deadly and his cold arm is long but arvedui did not take his counsel he thanked him and at parting gave him his ring saying this is a dung of worth beyond your reckoning for its ancientry alone it has no power save the esteem in which those hold it who love my house it will not help you but if ever you are in need my kin will ransom it with great store of all that you desire yet the counsel of the lossoth was good by chance or by foresight for the ship had not reached the open sea when a great storm of wind arose and came with blinding snow out of the north and it drove the ship back upon the ice and piled ice up against it even the mariners of cнrdan were helpless and in the night the ice crushed the hull and the ship foundered so perished arvedui lastking and with him the palantнri were buried in the sea it was long afterwards that news of the shipwreck of forochel was learned from the snowmen the shirefolk survived though war swept over them and most of them fled into hiding to the help of the king they sent some archers who never returned and others went also to the battle in which angmar was overthrown afterwards in the peace that followed the shirefolk ruled themselves and prospered they chose a thain to take the place of the king and were content though for a long time many still looked for the return of the king but at last that hope was forgotten and remained only in the saying when the king comes back used of some good that could not be achieved or of some evil that could not be amended the first shirethain was one bucca of the marish from whom the oldbucks claimed descent he became thain in of our reckoning after arvedui the northkingdom ended for the dъnedain were now few and all the peoples of eriador diminished yet the line of the kings was continued by the chieftains of the dъnedain of whom aranarth son of arvedui was the first arahael his son was fostered in rivendell and so were all the sons of the chieftains after him and there also were kept the heirlooms of their house the ring of barahir the shards of narsil the star of elendil and the sceptre of annъminas when the kingdom ended the dъnedain passed into the shadows and became a secret and wandering people and their deeds and labours were seldom sung or recorded little now is remembered of them since elrond departed although even before the watchful peace ended evil things again began to attack eriador or to invade it secretly the chieftains for the most part lived out their long lives aragorn i it is said was slain by wolves which ever after remained a peril in eriador and are not yet ended in the days of arahad i the orcs who had as later appeared long been secretly occupying strongholds in the misty mountains so as to bar all the passes into eriador suddenly revealed themselves in celebrнan wife of elrond was journeying to lуrien when she was waylaid in the redhorn pass and her escort being scattered by the sudden assault of the orcs she was seized and carried off she was pursued and rescued by elladan and elrohir but not before she had suffered torment and had received a poisoned wound she was brought back to imladris and though healed in body by elrond lost all delight in middleearth and the next year went to the havens and passed over sea and later in the days of arassuil orcs multiplying again in the misty mountains begin to ravage the lands and the dъnedain and the sons of elrond fought with them it was at this time that a large band came so far west as to enter the shire and were driven off by bandobras took there were fourteen chieftains before the fifteenth and last was born aragorn ii who became again king of born gondor and arnor our king we call him and when he comes north to his house in annъminas restored and stays for a while by lake evendim then everyone in the shire is glad but he does not enter this land and binds himself by the law that he has made that none of the big people shall pass its borders but he rides often with many fair people to the great bridge and there he welcomes his friends and any others who wish to see him and some ride away with him and stay in his house as long as they have a mind thain peregrin has been there many times and so has master samwise the mayor his daughter elanor the fair is one of the maids of queen evenstar it was the pride and wonder of the northern line that though their power departed and their people dwindled through all the many generations the succession was unbroken from father to son also though the length of the lives of the dъnedain grew ever less in middleearth after the ending of their kings the waning was swifter in gondor and many of the chieftains of the north still lived to twice the age of men and far beyond the days of even the oldest amongst us aragorn indeed lived to be two hundred and ten years old longer than any of his line since king arvegil but in aragorn elessar the dignity of the kings of old was renewed gondor and the heirs of anбrion there were thirtyone kings in gondor after anбrion win was slain before the baraddыr though war never ceased on their borders for more than a thousand years the dъnedain of the south grew in wealth and power by land and sea until the reign of atanatar ii who was called alcarin the glorious yet the signs of decay had then already appeared for the high men of the south married late and their children were few the first childless king was falastur and the second narmacil i the son of atanatar alcarin it was ostoher the seventh king who rebuilt minas anor where afterwards the kings dwelt in summer rather than in osgiliath in his time gondor was first attacked by wild men out of the east but tarostar his son defeated them and drove them out and took the name of rуmendacil eastvictor he was however later slain in battle with fresh hordes of easterlings turambar his son avenged him and won much territory eastwards with tarannon the twelfth king began the line of the shipkings who built navies and extended the sway of gondor along the coasts west and south of the mouths of anduin to commemorate his victories as captain of the hosts tarannon took the crown in the name of falastur lord of the coasts eдrnil i his nephew who succeeded him repaired the ancient haven of pelargir and built a great navy he laid siege by sea and land to umbar and took it and it became a great harbour and fortress of the power of gondor but eдrnil did not long survive his triumph he was lost with many ships and men in a great storm off umbar ciryandil his son continued the building of ships but the men of the harad led by the lords that had been driven from umbar came up with great power against that stronghold and ciryandil fell in battle in haradwaith for many years umbar was invested but could not be taken because of the seapower of gondor ciryaher son of ciryandil bided his time and at last when he had gathered strength he came down from the north by sea and by land and crossing the river harnen his armies utterly defeated the men of the harad and their kings were compelled to acknowledge the overlordship of gondor ciryaher then took the name of hyarmendacil southvictor the might of hyarmendacil no enemy dared to contest during the remainder of his long reign he was king for one hundred and thirtyfour years the longest reign but one of all the line of anбrion in his day gondor reached the summit of its power the realm then extended north to celebrant and the southern eaves of mirkwood west to the greyflood east to the inland sea of rhыn south to the river harnen and thence along the coast to the peninsula and haven of umbar the men of the vales of anduin acknowledged its authority and the kings of the harad did homage to gondor and their sons lived as hostages in the court of its king mordor was desolate but was watched over by great fortresses that guarded the passes so ended the line of the shipkings atanatar alcarin son of hyarmendacil lived in great splendour so that men said precious stones are pebbles in gondor for children to play with but atanatar loved ease and did nothing to maintain the power that he had inherited and his two sons were of like temper the waning of gondor had already begun before he died and was doubtless observed by its enemies the watch upon mordor was neglected nonetheless it was not until the days of valacar that the first great evil came upon gondor the civil war of the kinstrife in which great loss and ruin was caused and never fully repaired minalcar son of calmacil was a man of great vigour and in narmacil to rid himself of all cares made him regent of the realm from that time onwards he governed gondor in the name of the kings until he succeeded his father his chief concern was with the northmen these had increased greatly in the peace brought by the power of gondor the kings showed them favour since they were the nearest in kin of lesser men to the dъnedain and they gave them wide lands beyond anduin south of greenwood the great to be a defence against men of the east for in the past the attacks of the easterlings had come mostly over the plain between the inland sea and the ash mountains in the days of narmacil i their attacks began again though at first with little force but it was learned by the regent that the northmen did not always remain true to gondor and some would join forces with the easterlings either out of greed for spoil or in the furtherance of feuds among their princes minalcar therefore in led out a great force and between rhovanion and the inland sea he defeated a large army of the easterlings and destroyed all their camps and settlements east of the sea he then took the name of rуmendacil on his return rуmendacil fortified the west shore of anduin as far as the inflow of the limlight and forbade any stranger to pass down the river beyond the emyn muil he it was that built the pillars of the argonath at the entrance to nen hithoel but since he needed men and desired to strengthen the bond between gondor and the northmen he took many of them into his service and gave to some high rank in his armies rуmendacil showed especial favour to vidugavia who had aided him in the war he called himself king of rhovanion and was indeed the most powerful of the northern princes though his own realm lay between greenwood and the river celduin in rуmendacil sent his son valacar as an ambassador to dwell for a while with vidugavia and make himself acquainted with the language manners and policies of the northmen but valacar far exceeded his fathers designs he grew to love the northern lands and people and he married vidumavi daughter of vidugavia it was some years before he returned from this marriage came later the war of the kinstrife for the high men of gondor already looked askance at the northmen among them and it was a thing unheard of before that the heir to the crown or any son of the king should wed one of lesser and alien race there was already rebellion in the southern provinces when king valacar grew old his queen had been a fair and noble lady but shortlived according to the fate of lesser men and the dъnedain feared that her descendants would prove the same and fall from the majesty of the kings of men also they were unwilling to accept as lord her son who though he was now called eldacar had been born in an alien country and was named in his youth vinitharya a name of his mothers people therefore when eldacar succeeded his father there was war in gondor but eldacar did not prove easy to thrust from his heritage to the lineage of gondor he added the fearless spirit of the northmen he was handsome and valiant and showed no sign of ageing more swiftly than his father when the confederates led by descendants of the kings rose against him he opposed them to the end of his strength at last he was besieged in osgiliath and held it long until hunger and the greater forces of the rebels drove him out leaving the city in flames in that siege and burning the tower of the stone of osgiliath was destroyed and the palantнr was lost in the waters but eldacar eluded his enemies and came to the north to his kinsfolk in rhovanion many gathered to him there both of the northmen in the service of gondor and of the dъnedain of the northern parts of the realm for many of the latter had learned to esteem him and many more came to hate his usurper this was castamir grandson of calimehtar younger brother of rуmendacil ii he was not only one of those nearest by blood to the crown but be had the greatest following of all the rebels for he was the captain of ships and was supported by the people of the coasts and of the great havens of pelargir and umbar castamir had not long sat upon the throne before he proved himself haughty and ungenerous he was a cruel man as be had first shown in the taking of osgiliath he caused ornendil son of eldacar who was captured to be put to death and the slaughter and destruction done in the city at his bidding far exceeded the needs of war this was remembered in minas anor and in ithilien and there love for castamir was further lessened when it became seen that he cared little for the land and thought only of the fleets and purposed to remove the kings seat to pelargir thus he had been king only ten years when eldacar seeing his time came with a great army out of the north and folk flocked to him from calenardhon and anуrien and ithilien there was a great battle in lebennin at the crossings of erui in which much of the best blood in gondor was shed eldacar himself slew castamir in combat and so was avenged for ornendil but castamirs sons escaped and with others of their kin and many people of the fleets they held out long at pelargir when they had gathered there all the force that they could they sailed away and established themselves at umbar there they made a refuge for all the enemies of the king and a lordship independent of his crown umbar remained at war with gondor for many lives of men a threat to its coastlands and to all traffic on the sea it was never again completely subdued until the days of elessar and the region of south gondor became a debatable land between the corsairs and the kings the loss of umbar was grievous to gondor not only because the realm was diminished in the south and its hold upon the men of the harad was loosened but because it was there that arpharazфn the golden last king of nъmenor had landed and humbled the might of sauron though great evil had come after even the followers of elendil remembered with pride the coming of the great host of arpharazфn out of the deeps of the sea and on the highest hill of the headland above the haven they had set a great white pillar as a monument it was crowned with a globe of crystal that took the rays of the sun and of the moon and shone like a bright star that could be seen in clear weather even on the coasts of gondor or far out upon the western sea so it stood until after the second arising of sauron which now approached umbar fell under the domination of his servants and the memorial of his humiliation was thrown down after the return of eldacar the blood of the kingly house and other houses of the dъnedain became more mingled with that of lesser men for many of the great had been slain in the kinstrife while eldacar showed favour to the northmen by whose help he had regained the crown and the people of gondor were replenished by great numbers that came from rhovanion this mingling did not at first hasten the waning of the dъnedain as had been feared but the waning still proceeded little by little as it had before for no doubt it was due above all to middleearth itself and to the slow withdrawing of the gifts of the nъmenoreans after the downfall of the land of the star eldacar lived to his two hundred and thirtyfifth year and was king for fiftyeight years of which tea were spent in exile the second and greatest evil came upon gondor in the reign of telemnar the twentysixth king whose father minardil son of eldacar was slain at pelargir by the corsairs of umbar soon after a deadly plague came with dark winds out of the east the king and all his children died and great numbers of the people of gondor especially those that lived in osgiliath then for weariness and fewness of men the watch on the borders of mordor ceased and the fortresses that guarded the passes were unmanned later it was noted that these things happened even as the shadow grew deep in greenwood and many evil things reappeared signs of the arising of sauron it is true that the enemies of gondor also suffered or they might have overwhelmed it in its weakness but sauron could wait and it may well be that the opening of mordor was what he chiefly desired when king telemnar died the white tree of minas anor also withered and died but tarondor his nephew who succeeded him replanted a seedling in the citadel he it was who removed the kings house permanently to minas anor for osgiliath was now partly deserted and began to fall into ruin few of those who had fled from the plague into ithilien or to the western dales were willing to return tarondor coming young to the throne had the longest reign of all the kings of gondor but he could achieve little more than the reordering of his realm within and the slow nursing of its strength but telumehtar his son remembering the death of minardil and being troubled by the insolence of the corsairs who raided his coasts even as far as the anfalas gathered his forces and in took umbar by storm in that war the last descendants of castamir perished and umbar was again held for a while by the kings telumehtar added to his name the title umbardacil but in the new evils that soon befell gondor umbar was again lost and fell into the hands of the men of the harad the third evil was the invasion of the wainriders which sapped the waning strength of gondor in wars that lasted for almost a hundred years the wainriders were a people or a confederacy of many peoples that came from the east but they were stronger and better armed than any that had appeared before they journeyed in great wains and their chieftains fought in chariots stirred up as was afterwards seen by the emissaries of sauron they made a sudden assault upon gondor and king narmacil ii was slain in battle with them beyond anduin in the people of eastern and southern rhovanion were enslaved and the frontiers of gondor were for that time withdrawn to the anduin and the emyn muil calimehtar son of narmacil ii helped by a revolt in rhovanion avenged his father with a great victory over the easterlings upon dagorlad in and for a while the peril was averted it was in the reign of araphant in the north and of ondoher son of calimehtar in the south that the two kingdoms again took counsel together after long silence and estrangement for at last they perceived that some single power and will was directing the assault from many quarters upon the survivors of nъmenor it was at that time that arvedui heir of araphant wedded fнriel daughter of ondoher but neither kingdom was able to send help to the other for angmar renewed its attack upon arthedain at the same time as the wainriders reappeared in great force many of the wainriders now passed south of mordor and made alliance with men of khand and of near harad and in this great assault from north and south gondor came near to destruction in king ondoher and both his sons artamir and faramir fell in battle north of the morannon and the enemy poured into ithilien but eдrnil captain of the southern army won a great victory in south ithilien and destroyed the army of harad that had crossed the river poros hastening north he gathered to him all that he could of the retreating northern army and came up against the main camp of the wainriders while they were feasting and revelling believing that gondor was overthrown and that nothing remained but to take the spoil eдrnil stormed the camp and set fire to the wains and drove the enemy in a great rout out of ithilien a great part of those who fled before him perished in the dead marshes on the death of ondoher and his sons arvedui of the northkingdom claimed the crown of gondor as the direct descendant of isildur and as the husband of fнriel only surviving child of ondoher the claim was rejected in this pelendur the steward of king ondoher played the chief part the council of gondor answered the crown and royalty of gondor belongs solely to the heirs of meneldil son of anбrion to whom isildur relinquished this realm in gondor this heritage is reckoned through the sons only and we have not heard that the law is otherwise in arnor to this arvedui replied elendil had two sons of whom isildur was the elder and the heir of his father we have heard that the name of elendil stands to this day at the head of the line of the kings of gondor since he was accounted the high king of all the lands of the dъnedain while elendil still lived the conjoint rule in the south was committed to his sons but when elendil fell isildur departed to take up the high kingship of his father and committed the rule in the south in like manner to the son of his brother he did not relinquish his royalty in gondor nor intend that the realm of elendil should be divided for ever moreover in nъmenor of old the sceptre descended to the eldest child of the king whether man or woman it is true that the law has not been observed in the lands of exile ever troubled by war but such was the law of our people to which we now refer seeing that the sons of ondoher died childless to this gondor made no answer the crown was claimed by eдrnil the victorious captain and it was granted to him with the approval of all the dъnedain in gondor since he was of the royal house he was the son of siriondil son of calimmacil son of arciryas brother of narmacil ii arvedui did not press his claim for he had neither the power nor the will to oppose the choice of the dъnedain of gondor yet the claim was never forgotten by his descendants even when their kingship had passed away for the time was now drawing near when the northkingdom would come to an end arvedui was indeed the last king as his name signifies it is said that this name was given to him at his birth by malbeth the seer who said to his father arvedui you shall call him for he will be the last in arthedain though a choice will come to the dъnedain and if they take the one that seems less hopeful then your son will change his name and become king of a great realm if not then much sorrow and many lives of men shall pass until the dъnedain arise and are united again in gondor also one king only followed eдrnil it may be that if the crown and the sceptre had been united then the kingship would have been maintained and much evil averted but eдrnil was a wise man and not arrogant even if as to most men in gondor the realm in arthedain seemed a small thing for all the lineage of its lords he sent messages to arvedui announcing that he received the crown of gondor according to the laws and the needs of the southkingdom but i do not forget the loyalty of arnor nor deny our kinship nor wish that the realms of elendil should be estranged i will send to your aid when you have need so far as i am able it was however long before eдrnil felt himself sufficiently secure to do as he promised king araphant continued with dwindling strength to hold off the assaults of angmar and arvedui when he succeeded did likewise but at last in the autumn of messages came to gondor that arthedain was in great straits and that the witchking was preparing a last stroke against it then eдrnil sent his son eдrnur north with a fleet as swiftly as he could and with as great strength as he could spare too late before eдrnur reached the havens of lindon the witchking had conquered arthedain and arvedui had perished but when eдrnur came to the grey havens there was joy and great wonder among both elves and men so great in draught and so many were his ships that they could scarcely find harbourage though both the harlond and the forlond also were filled and from them descended an army of power with munition and provision for a war of great kings or so it seemed to the people of the north though this was but a small sendingforce of the whole might of gondor most of all the horses were praised for many of them came from the vales of anduin and with themwere riders tall and fair and proud princes of rhovanion then cнrdan summoned all who would come to him from lindon or arnor and when all was ready the host crossed the lune and marched norm to challenge the witchking of angmar he was now dwelling it is said in fornost which he had filled with evil folk usurping the house and rule of the kings in his pride he did not await the onset of his enemies in his stronghold but went out to meet them thinking to sweep them as others before into the lune but the host of the west came down on him out of the hills of evendim and were was a great battle on the plain between nenuial and the north downs the forces of angmar were already giving way and retreating towards fornost when the main body of the horsemen that had passed round the hills came down from the north and scattered them in a great rout then the witchking with all that he could gather from the wreck fled northwards seeking his own land of angmar before he could gain the shelter of carn dыm the cavalry of gondor overtook him with eдrnur riding at their head at the same time a force under glorfindel the elflord came up out of rivendell then so utterly was angmar defeated that not a man nor an orc of that realm remained west of the mountains but it is said that when au was lost suddenly the witchking himself appeared blackrobed and blackmasked upon a black horse fear fell upon all who beheld him but he singled out the captain of gondor for the fullness of his hatred and with a terrible cry he rode straight upon him eдrnur would have withstood him but his horse could not endure that onset and it swerved and bore him far away before he could master it then the witchking laughed and none that heard it ever forgot the horror of that cry but glorfindel rode up then on his white horse and in the midst of his laughter the witchking turned to flight and passed into the shadows for night came down on the battlefield and he was lost and none saw whither he went eдrnur now rode back but glorfindel looking into the gathering dark said do not pursue him he will not return to this land far off yet is his doom and not by the hand of man will he fall these words many remembered but eдrnur was angry desiring only to be avenged for his disgrace so ended the evil realm of angmar and so did eдrnur captain of gondor earn the chief hatred of the witchking but many years were still to pass before that was revealed it was thus in the reign of king eдrnil as later became clear that the witchking escaping from the north came to mordor and there gathered the other ringwraiths of whom he was the chief but it was not until that they issued from mordor by the pass of cirith ungol and laid siege to minas ithil this they took in and captured the palantнr of the tower they were not expelled while the third ago lasted and minas ithil became a place of fear and was renamed minas morgul many of the people that still remained in ithilien deserted it eдrnur was a man like his father in valour but not in wisdom he was a man of strong body and hot mood but he would take no wife for his only pleasure was in fighting or in the exercise of arms his prowess was such that none in gondor could stand against him in those weaponsports in which he delighted seeming rather a champion than a captain or king and retaining his vigour and skill to a later age than was then usual when eдrnur received the crown in the king of minas morgul challenged him to single combat taunting him that he had not dared to stand before him in battle in the north for that time mardil the steward restrained the wrath of the king minas anor which had become the chief city of the realm since the days of king telemnar and the residence of the kings was now renamed minas tirith as the city ever on guard against the evil of morgul eдrnur had held the crown only seven years when the lord of morgul repeated his challenge taunting the king that to the faint heart of his youth he had now added the weakness of age then mardil could no longer restrain him and he rode with a small escort of knights to the gate of minas morgul none of that riding were ever heard of again it was believed in gondor that the faithless enemy had trapped the king and that he had died in torment in minas morgul but since there were no witnesses of his death mardil the good steward ruled gondor in his name for many years now the descendants of the kings had become few their numbers had been greatly diminished in the kinstrife whereas since that time the kings had become jealous and watchful of those near akin often those on whom suspicion fell had fled to umbar and there joined the rebels while others had renounced their lineage and taken wives not of nъmenorean blood so it was that no claimant to the crown could be found who was of pure blood or whose claim all would allow and all feared the memory of the kinstrife knowing that if any such dissension arose again then gondor would perish therefore though the years lengthened the steward continued to rule gondor and the crown of elendil lay in the lap of king eдrnil in the houses of the dead where eдrnur had left it the stewards the house of the stewards was called the house of hъrin for they were descendants of the steward of king minardil hъrin of emyn arnen a man of high nъmenorean race after his day the kings had always chosen their stewards from among his descendants and after the days of pelendur the stewardship became hereditary as a kingship from father to son or nearest kin each new steward indeed took office with the oath to hold rod and rule in the name of the king until he shall return but these soon became words of ritual little heeded for the stewards exercised all the power of the kings yet many in gondor still believed that a king would indeed return in some time to come and some remembered the ancient line of the north which it was rumoured still lived on in the shadows but against such thoughts the ruling stewards hardened their hearts nonetheless the stewards never sat on the ancient throne and they wore no crown and held no sceptre they bore a white rod only as the token of their office and their banner was white without charge but the royal banner had been sable upon which was displayed a white tree in blossom beneath seven stars after mardil voronwл who was reckoned the first of the line there followed twentyfour ruling stewards of gondor until the time of denethor ii the twentysixth and last at first they had quiet for those were the days of the watchful peace during which sauron withdrew before the power of the white council and the ringwraiths remained hidden in morgul vale but from the time of denethor i there was never full peace again and even when gondor had no great or open war its borders were under constant threat in the last years of denethor i the race of uruks black orcs of great strength first appeared out of mordor and in they swept across ithilien and took osgiliath boromir son of denethor defeated them and regained ithilien but osgiliath was finally ruined and its great stonebridge was broken no people dwelt there afterwards boromir was a great captain and even the witchking feared him he was noble and fair of face a man strong in body and in will but he received a morgulwound in that war which shortened his days and he became shrunken with pain and died twelve year after his father after him began the long rule of cirion he was watchful and wary but the reach of gondor had grown short and he could do little more than defend his borders while his enemies prepared strokes against him that he could not hinder the corsairs harried his coasts but it was in the norm mat his chief peril lay in the wide lands of rhovanion between mirkwood and the river running a fierce people now dwelt wholly under the shadow of dol guldur often they made raids through the forest until the vale of anduin south of the gladden was largely deserted these balchoth were constantly increased by others of like kind that came in from the east whereas the people of calenardhon had dwindled cirion was hard put to it to hold the line of the anduin foreseeing the storm cirion sent north for aid but overlate for in that year the balchoth having built many great boats and rafts on the east shores of anduin swarmed over the river and swept away the defenders an army marching up from the south was cut off and driven north over the limlight and there it was suddenly attacked by a horde of orcs from the mountains and pressed towards the anduin then out of the north there came help beyond hope and the horns of the rohirrim were first heard in gondor eorl the young came with his riders and swept away the enemy and pursued the balchoth to the death over the fields of calenardhon cirion granted to eorl that land to dwell in and he swore to cirion the oath of eorl of friendship at need or at call to the lords of gondor in the days of beren the nineteenth steward an even greater peril came upon gondor three great fleets long prepared came up from umbar and the harad and assailed the coasts of gondor in great force and the enemy made many landings even as far north as the mouth of the isen at the lame time the rohirrim were assailed from the west and the east and their land was overrun and they were driven into the dales of the white mountains in that year the long winter began with cold and great snows out of the north and the east which lasted for almost five months helm of rohan and both his sons perished in that war and there was misery and death in eriador and in rohan but in gondor south of the mountains things were less evil and before spring came beregond son of beren bad overcome the invaders at once he sent aid to rohan he was the greatest captain that had arisen in gondor since boromir and when he succeeded his father gondor began to recover its strength but rohan was slower to be healed of the hurts that it had received it was for this reason that beren welcomed saruman and gave to him the keys of orthanc and from that year on saruman dwelt in isengard it was in the days of beregond that the war of the dwarves and orcs was fought in the misty mountains of which only rumour came south until theorcs fleeing from nanduhirion attempted to cross rohan and establish themselves in the white mountains there was fighting for many years in the dales before that danger was ended when belecthor ii the twentyfirst steward died the white tree died also in minas tirith but it was left standing until the king returns for no seedling could be found in the days of turin ii the enemies of gondor began to move again for sauron was grown again to power and the day of his arising was drawing near all but the hardiest of its people deserted ithilien and removed west over anduin for the land was infested by mordororcs it was tъrin that built secret refuges for his soldiers in ithilien of which kenneth annыn was the longest guarded and manned he also fortified again the isle of cair andros to defend anrien but his chief peril lay in the south where the haradrim had occupied south gondor and there was much fighting along the poros when ithilien was invaded in great strength king folcwine of rohan fulfilled the oath of eorl and repaid his debt for the aid brought by beregond sending many men to gondor with their aid tъrin won a victory at the crossings of the poros but the sons of folcwine both fell in the battle the riders buried them after the fashion of their people and they were laid in one mound for they were twin brothers long it stood haudh in gwanыr high upon the shore of the river and the enemies of gondor feared to pass it turgon followed turin but of his time it is chiefly remembered that two years ere his death sauron arose again and declared himself openly and he reentered mordor long prepared for him then the baraddыr was raised once more and mount doom burst into flame and the last of the folk of ithilien fled far away when turgon died saruman took isengard for his own and fortified it ecthelion ii son of turgon was a man of wisdom with what power was left to him he began to strengthen his realm against the assault of mordor he encouraged all men of worth from near or far to enter his service and to those who proved trustworthy he gave rank and reward in much that he did he had the aid and advice of a great captain whom he loved above all thorongil men called him in gondor the eagle of the star for he was swift and keeneyed and wore a silver star upon his cloak but no one knew his true name nor in what land he was born he came to ecthelion from rohan where he had served the king thengel but he was not one of the rohirrim he was a great leader of men by land or by sea but he departed into the shadows whence he came before the days of ecthelion were ended thorongil often counselled ecthelion that the strength of the rebels in umbar was a great peril to gondor and a threat to the fiefs of the south that would prove deadly if sauron moved to open war at last he got leave of the steward and gathered a small fleet and he came to umbar unlookedfor by night and there burned a great part of the ships of the corsairs he himself overthrew the captain of the haven in battle upon the quays and then he withdrew his fleet with small loss but when they came back to pelargir to mens grief and wonder he would not return to minas tirith where great honour awaited him he sent a message of farewell to ecthelion saying other tasks now call me lord and much time and many perils must pass ere i come again to gondor if that be my fate though none could guess what those tasks might be nor what summons he had received it was known whither he went for he took boat and crossed over anduin and there he said farewell to his companions and went on alone and when he was last seen his face was towards the mountains of shadow there was dismay in the city at the departure of thorongil and to all men it seemed a great loss unless it were to denethor the son of ecthelion a man now ripe for the stewardship to which after four years he succeeded on the death of his father denethor ii was a proud man tall valiant and more kingly than any man that had appeared in condor for many lives of men and he was wise also and farsighted and learned in lore indeed he was as like to thorongil as to one of nearest kin and yet was ever placed second to the stranger in the hearts of men and the esteem of his father at the time many thought that thorongil had departed before his rival became his master though indeed thorongil had never himself vied with denethor nor held himself higher than the servant of his father and in one matter only were their counsels to the steward at variance thorongil often warned ecthelion not to put trust in saruman the white in isengard but to welcome rather gandalf the grey but there was little love between denethor and gandalf and after the days of ecthelion there was less welcome for the grey pilgrim in minas tirith therefore later when all was made clear many believed that denethor who was subtle in mind and looked further and deeper than other men of his day had discovered who this stranger thorongil in truth was and suspected that he and mithrandir designed to supplant him when denethor became steward he proved a masterful lord holding the rule of all things in his own hand he said little he listened to counsel and then followed his own mind he had married late taking as wife finduilas daughter of adrahil of dot amroth she was a lady of great beauty and gentle heart but before twelve years had passed she died denethor loved her in his fashion more dearly than any other unless it were the elder of the sons that she bore him but it seemed to men that she withered in the guarded city as a flower of the seaward vales set upon a barren rock the shadow in the east filled her with horror and she turned her eyes ever south to the sea that she missed after her death denethor became more grim and silent than before and would sit long alone in his tower deep in thought foreseeing that the assault of mordor would come in his time it was afterwards believed that needing knowledge but being proud and trusting in his own strength of will he dared to look in the palantнr of the white tower none of the stewards had dared to do this nor even the kings eдrnil and eдrnur after the fall of minas ithil when the palantнr of isildur came into the hands of the enemy for the stone of minas tirith was the palantнr of anбrion most close in accord with the one that sauron possessed in this way denethor gained his great knowledge of things that passed in his realm and far beyond his borders at which men marvelled but he bought the knowledge dearly being aged before his time by his contest with the will of sauron thus pride increased in denethor together with despair until he saw in all the deeds of that time only a single combat between the lord of the white tower and the lord of the baraddыr and mistrusted all others who resisted sauron unless they served himself alone so time drew on to the war of the ring and the sons of denethor grew to manhood boromir five years the elder beloved by his father was like him in face and pride but in little else rather he was a man after the sort of king eдrnur of old taking no wife and delighting chiefly in arms fearless and strong but caring little for lore save the tales of old battles faramir the younger was like him in looks but otherwise in mind he read the hearts of men as shrewdly as his father but what he read moved him sooner to pity than to scorn he was gentle in bearing and a lover of lore and of music and therefore by many in those days his courage was judged less than his brothers but it was not so except that he did not seek glory in danger without a purpose he welcomed gandalf at such times as he came to the city and he learned what he could from his wisdom and in this as in many other matters he displeased his father yet between the brothers there was great love and had been since childhood when boromir was the helper and protector of faramir no jealousy or rivalry had arisen between them since for their fathers favour or for the praise of men it did not seem possible to faramir that any one in gondor could rival boromir heir of denethor captain of the white tower and of like mind was boromir yet it proved otherwise at the test but of all that befell these three in the war of the ring much is said elsewhere and after the war the days of the ruling stewards came to an end for the heir of isildur and anбrion returned and the kingship was renewed and the standard of the white tree flew once more from the tower of ecthelion here follows a part of the tale of aragorn and arwen arador was the grandfather of the king his son arathorn sought in marriage gilraen the fair daughter of dнrhael who was himself a descendant of aranarth to this marriage dнrhael was opposed for gilraen was young and had not leached the age at which the women of the dъnedain wen accustomed to marry moreover he said arathorn is a stern man of full age and will be chieftain sooner than men looked for yet my heart forebodes mat he will be shortlived but ivorwen his wife who was also foresighted answered the more need of haste the days are darkening before the storm and great things are to come if these two wed now hope may be born for our people but if they delay it will not come while this age lasts and it happened that when arathorn and gilraen had been married only one year arador was taken by hilltrolls in the coldfells north of rivendell and was slain and arathorn became chieftain of the dъnedain the next year gilraen bore him a son and he was called aragorn but aragorn was only two years old when arathorn went riding against the orcs with the sons of elrond and he was slain by an orcarrow that pierced his eye and so he proved indeed shortlived for one of his race being but sixty years old when befell then aragorn being now the heir of isildur was taken with his mother to dwell in the house of elrond and elrond took the place of his father and came to love him as a son of his own but he was called estel that is hope and his true name and lineage were kept secret at the bidding of elrond for the wise then knew that the enemy was seeking to discover the heir of isildur if any remained upon earth but when estel was only twenty years of age it chanced that he returned to rivendell after great deeds in the company of the sons of elrond and elrond looked at him and was pleased for he saw that he was fair and noble and was early come to manhood though he would yet become greater in body and in mind that day therefore elrond called him by his true name and told him who he was and whose son and he delivered to him the heirlooms of his house here is the ring of barahir he said the token of our kinship from afar and here also are the shards of narsil with these you may yet do great deeds for i foretell that the span of your life shall be greater than the measure of men unless evil befalls you or you fail at the test but the test will be hard and long the sceptre of annъminas i withhold for you have yet to earn it the next day at the hour of sunset aragorn walked alone in we woods and his heart was high within him and he sang for he was full of hope and the world was fair and suddenly even as he sang he saw a maiden walking on a greensward among the white stems of the birches and he halted amazed thinking that he had strayed into a dream or else that he had received the gift of the elfminstrels who can make the things of which they sing appear before the eyes of those that listen for aragorn had been singing a part of the lay of lъthien which tells of the meeting of lъthien and beren in the forest of neldoreth and behold there lъthien walked before his eyes in rivendell clad in a mantle of silver and blue fair as the twilight in elvenhome her dark hair strayed in a sudden wind and her brows were bound with gems like stars for a moment aragorn gazed in silence but fearing that she would pass away and never be seen again he called to her crying tinъviel tinъviel even as beren had done in the elder days long ago then the maiden turned to him and smiled and she said who are you and why do you call the by that name and he answered because i believed you to be indeed lъthien tinъviel of whom i was singing but if you are not she then you walk in her likeness so many have said she answered gravely yet her name is not mine though maybe my doom will be not unlike hers but who are you estel i was called he said but i am aragorn arathorns son isildurs heir lord of the dъnedain yet even in the saying he felt that this high lineage in which his heart had rejoiced was now of little worth and as nothing compared to her dignity and loveliness but she laughed merrily and said then we are akin from afar for i am arwen elronds daughter and am named also undуmiel often is it seen said aragorn that in dangerous days men hide their chief treasure yet i marvel at elrond and your brothers for though i have dwelt in this house from childhood i have heard no word of you how comes it that we have never met before surely your father has not kept you locked in his hoard no she said and looked up at the mountains that rose in the east i have dwelt for a time in the land of my mothers kin in far lothlуrien i have but lately returned to visit my father again it is many years since i walked in imladris then aragorn wondered for she had seemed of no greater age than he who had lived yet no more than a score of years in middleearth but arwen looked in his eyes and said do not wonder for the children of elrond have the life of the eldar then aragorn was abashed for he saw the elvenlight in her eyes and the wisdom of many days yet from that hour he loved arwen undуmiel daughter of elrond in the days that followed aragorn fell silent and his mother perceived that some strange thing bad befallen him and at last he yielded to her questions and told her of the meeting in the twilight of the trees my son said gilraen your aim is high even for the descendant of many kings for this lady is the noblest and fairest that now walks the earth and it is not fit that mortal should wed with the elfkin yet we have some part in that kinship said aragorn if the tale of my forefathers is true that i have learned it is true said gilraen but that was long ago and in another age of this world before our race was diminished therefore i am afraid for without the good will of master elrond the heirs of isildur will soon come to an end but i do not think that you will have the good will of elrond in this matter then bitter will my days be and i will walk in the wild alone said aragorn that will indeed be your fate said gilraen but though she had in a measure the foresight of her people she said no more to him of her foreboding nor did she speak to any one of what her son had told her but elrond saw many things and read many hearts one day therefore before the fall of the year he called aragorn to his chamber and he said aragorn arathorns son lord of the dъnedain listen to me a great doom awaits you either to rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of elendil or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin many years of trial lie before you you shall neither have wife nor bind any woman to you in troth until your time comes and you are found worthy of it then aragorn was troubled and he said can it be that my mother has spoken of this no indeed said elrond your own eyes have betrayed you but i do not speak of my daughter alone you shall be betrothed to no mans child as yet but as for arwen the fair lady of imladris and of lуrien evenstar of her people she is of lineage greater than yours and she has lived in the world already so long that to her you are but as a yearling shoot beside a young birch of many summers she is too far above you and so i think it may well seem to her but even if it were not so and her heart turned towards you i should still be grieved because of the doom that is laid on us what is that doom said aragorn that so long as i abide here she shall live with the youth of the eldar answered elrond and when i depart she shall go with the if she so chooses i see said aragorn that i have turned my eyes to a treasure no less dear than the treasure of thingol that beren once desired such is my fate then suddenly the foresight of his kindred came to him and he said but lo master elrond the years of your abiding run short at last and the choice must soon be laid on your children to part either with you or with middleearth truly said elrond soon as we account it though many years of men must still pass but there will be no choice before arwen my beloved unless you aragorn arathorns son come between us and bring one of us you or me to a bitter parting beyond the end of the world yon do not know yet what you desire of me he sighed and after a while looking gravely upon the young man he said again the years will bring what they will we will speak no more of this until many have passed the days darken and much evil is to come then aragorn took leave lovingly of elrond and the next day he said farewell to his mother and to the house of elrond and to arwen and he went out into the wild for nearly thirty years he laboured in the cause against sauron and he became a friend of gandalf the wise from whom he gained much wisdom with him he made many perilous journeys but as the years wore on he went more often alone his ways were hard and long and he became somewhat grim to look upon unless he chanced to smile and yet he seemed to men worthy of honour as a king that is in exile when he did not hide his true shape for he went in many guises and won renown under many names he rode in the host of the rohirrim and fought for the lord of gondor by land and by sea and then in the hour of victory he passed out of the knowledge of men of the west and went alone far into the east and deep into the south exploring the hearts of men both evil and good and uncovering the plots and devices of the servants of sauron thus he became at last the most hardy of living men skilled in their crafts and lore and was yet more than they for he was elvenwise and there was a light in his eyes that when they were kindled few could endure his face was sad and stem because of the doom that was laid on him and yet hope dwelt ever in the depths of his heart from which mirth would arise at times like a spring from the rock it came to pass that when aragorn was nine and forty years of age he returned from perils on the dark confines of mordor where sauron now dwelt again and was busy with evil he was weary and he wished to go back to rivendell and rest there for a while ere he journeyed into the far countries and on his way he came to the borders of lуrien and was admitted to the hidden land by the lady galadriel he did not know it but arwen undуmiel was also there dwelling again for a time with the kin of her mother she was little changed for the mortal years had passed her by yet her face was more grave and her laughter now seldom was heard but aragorn was grown to full stature of body and mind and galadriel bade him cast aside his wayworn raiment and she clothed him in silver and white with a cloak of elvengrey and a bright gem on his brow then more than any kind of men he appeared and seemed rather an elflord from the isles of the west and thus it was that arwen first beheld him again after their long parting and as he came walking towards her under the trees of caras galadhon laden with flowers of gold her choice was made and her doom appointed then for a season they wandered together in the glades of lothlуrien until it was time for him to depart and on the evening of midsummer aragorn arathorns son and arwen daughter of elrond went to the fair hill cerin amroth in the midst of the land and they walked unshod on the undying grass with elanor and niphredil about their feet and there upon that hill they looked east to the shadow and west to the twilight and they plighted their troth and were glad and arwen said dark is the shadow and yet my heart rejoices for you estel shall be among the great whose valour will destroy it but aragorn answered alas i cannot foresee it and how lit may come to pass is hidden from me yet with your hope i will hope and the shadow i utterly reject but neither lady is the twilight for me for i am mortal and if you will cleave to me evenstar then the twilight you must also renounce and she stood then as still as a white tree looking into the west and at last she said i will cleave to you dъnadan and turn from the twilight yet there lies the land of my people and the long home of all my kin she loved her father dearly when elrond learned the choice of his daughter he was silent though his heart was grieved and found the doom long feared none the easier to endure but when aragorn came again to rivendell he called him to him and he said my son years come when hope will fade and beyond them little is clear to the and now a shadow lies between us maybe it has been appointed so that by my loss the kingship of men may be restored therefore though i love you i say to you arwen undуmiel shall not diminish her lifes grace lot less cause she shall not be the bride of any man less than the king of both gondor and arnor to the men even our victory can bring only sorrow and parting but to you hope of joy for a while for a while alas my son i fear that to arwen the doom of men may seem hard at the ending so it stood afterwards between elrond and aragorn and they spoke no more of this matter but aragorn went forth again to danger and toil and while the world darkened and fear fell on middleearth as the power of sauron grew and the baraddыr rose ever taller and stronger arwen remained in rivendell and when aragorn was abroad from afar she watched over him in thought and in hope she made for him a great and kingly standard such as only one might display who claimed the lordship of the nъmenoreans and the inheritance of elendil after a few years gilraen took leave of elrond and returned to her own people in eriador and lived alone and she seldom saw her son again for he spent many years in far countries but on a time when aragorn had returned to the north he came to her and she said to him before he went this is our last parting estel my son i am aged by care even as one of lesser men and now that it draws near i cannot face the darkness of our time that gathers upon middleearth i shall leave it soon aragorn tried to comfort her saying yet there may be a light beyond the darkness and if so i would have you see it and be glad but she answered only with this linnod уnen iestel edain ъchebin estel anim and aragorn went away heavy of heart gilraen died before the next spring thus the years drew on to the war of the ring of which more is told elsewhere how the means unforeseen was revealed whereby sauron might be overthrown and how hope beyond hope was fulfilled and it came to pass that in the hour of defeat aragorn came up from the sea and unfurled the standard of arwen in the battle of the fields of pelennor and in that day he was first hailed as king and at last when all was done he entered into the inheritance of his fathers and received the crown of gondor and sceptre of arnor and at midsummer in the year of the fall of sauron he took the hand of arwen undуmiel and they were wedded in the city of the kings the third age ended thus in victory and hope and yet grievous among the sorrows of that age was the parting of elrond and arwen for they were sundered by the sea and by a doom beyond the end of the world when the great ring was unmade and the three were shorn of their power then elrond grew weary at last and forsook middleearth never to return but arwen became as a mortal woman and yet it was not her lot to die until all that she had gained was lost as queen of elves and men she dwelt with aragorn for sixscore years in great glory and bliss yet at last he felt the approach of old age and knew that the span of his lifedays was drawing to an end long though it had been then aragorn said to arwen at last lady evenstar fairest in this world and most beloved my world is fading lo we have gathered and we have spent and now the time of payment draws near arwen knew well what he intended and long had foreseen it nonetheless she was overborne by her grief would you then lord before your time leave your people that live by your word she said not before my time he answered for if i will not go now then i must soon go perforce and eldarion our son is a man fullripe for kingship then going to the house of the kings in the silent street aragorn laid him down on the long bed that had been prepared for him there he said farewell to eldarion and gave into his hands the winged crown of gondor and the sceptre of arnor and then all left him save arwen and she stood alone by his bed and for all her wisdom and lineage she could not forbear to plead with him to stay yet for a while she was not yet weary of her days and thus she tasted the bitterness of the mortality that she had taken upon her lady undуmiel said aragorn the hour is indeed hard yet it was made even in that day when we met under the white birches in the garden of elrond where none now walk and on the hill of cerin amroth when we forsook both the shadow and the twilight this doom we accepted take counsel with yourself beloved and ask whether you would indeed have the wait until i wither and rail from my high seat unmanned and witless nay lady i am the last of the nъmenoreans and the latest king of the elder days and to me has been given not only a span thrice that of men of middleearth but also the grace to go at my will and give back the gift now therefore i will sleep i speak no comfort to you for there is no comfort for such pain within the circles of the world the uttermost choice is before you to repent and go to the havens and bear away into the west the memory of our days together that shall there be evergreen but never more than memory or else to abide the doom of men nay dear lord she said that choice is long over there is now no snip that would bear the hence and i must indeed abide the doom of men whether i will or i nill the loss and the silence but i say to you king of the nъmenoreans not till now have i understood the tale of your people and their fall as wicked fools i scorned them but i pity them at last for if this is indeed as the eldar say the gift of the one to men it is bitter to receive so it seems he said but let us not be overthrown at the final test who of old renounced the shadow and the ring in sorrow we must go but not in despair behold we are not bound for ever to the circles of the world and beyond them is more than memory farewell estel estel she cried and with that even as he took her hand and kissed it he fell into sleep then a great beauty was revealed in him so that all who after came there looked on him in wonder for they saw that the grace of his youth and the valour of his manhood and the wisdom and majesty of his age were blended together and long there he lay an image of the splendour of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world but arwen went forth from the house and the light of her eyes was quenched and it seemed to her people that she had become cold and grey as nightfall in winter that comes without a star then she said farewell to eldarion and to her daughters and to all whom she had loved and she went out from the city of minas tirith and passed away to the land of lуrien and dwelt there alone under the fading trees until winter came galadriel had passed away and celeborn also was gone and the land was silent there at last when the mallornleaves were falling but spring had not yet come she laid herself to rest upon cerin amroth and there is her green grave until the world is changed and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten by men that come after and elanor and niphredil bloom no more east of the sea here ends this tale as it has come to us from the south and with the passing of evenstar no more is said in this book of the days of old ii the house of eorl eorl the young was lord of the men of йothйod that land lay near the sources of anduin between the furthest ranges of the misty mountains and the northernmost parts of mirkwood the йothйod had moved to those regions in the days of king eдrnil ii from lands in the vales of anduin between the carrock and the gladden and they were in origin close akin to the beornings and the men of the westeaves of the forest the forefathers of eorl claimed descent from kings of rhovanion whose realm lay beyond mirkwood before the invasions of the wainriders and thus they accounted themselves kinsmen of the kings of gondor descended from eldacar they loved best the plains and delighted in horses and in all feats of horsemanship but there were many men in the middle vales of anduin in those days and moreover the shadow of dol guldur was lengthening when therefore they heard of the overthrow of the witchking they sought more room in the north and drove away the remnants of the people of angmar on the east side of the mountains but in the days of lйod father of eorl they had grown to be a numerous people and were again somewhat straitened in the land of their home in the two thousand five hundred and tenth year of the third age a new peril threatened gondor a great host of wild men from the northeast swept over rhovanion and coming down out of the brownlands crossed the anduin on rafts at the same time by chance or design the orcs made a descent from the mountains the invaders overran calenardhon and cirion steward of gondor sent north for help for there had been long friendship between the men of anduins vale and the people of gondor but in the valley of the river men were now few and scattered and slow to render such aid as they could at last tidings came to eorl of the need of gondor and late though it seemed he set out with a great host of riders thus he came to the battle of the field of celebrant for that was the name of the green land that lay between silverlode and limlight there the northern army of gondor was in peril defeated in the wold and cut off from the south it had been driven across the limlight and was then suddenly assailed by the orchost that pressed it towards the anduin all hope was lost when unlooked for the riders came out of the north and broke upon the rear of the enemy then the fortunes of battle were reversed and the enemy was driven with slaughter over limlight eorl led his men in pursuit and so great was the fear that went before horsemen of the north that the invaders of the wold were also thrown into panic and the riders hunted them over the plains of calenardhon the people of that region had become few since the plague and most of those that remained had been slaughtered by the savage easterlings cirion therefore in reward for his aid gave calenardhon between anduin and isen to eorl and his people and they sent north for their wives and children and their goods and sealed in that land they named it anew the mark of the riders and they called themselves the eorlingas but in gondor their land was called rohan and its people the rohirrim thus eorl became the first king of the mark and he chose for his dwelling a green hill before the feet of the white mountains that were the southwall of his land there the rohirrim lived afterwards as free men under their own kings and laws but in perpetual alliance with gondor many lords and warriors and many fair and valiant women are named in the songs of rohan that still remember the north frumgar they say was the name of the chieftain who led his people to йothйod of his son fram they tell that he slew scatha the great dragon of ered mithrin and the land had peace from the longworms afterwards thus fram won great wealth but was at feud with the dwarves who claimed the hoard of scatha fram would not yield them a penny and sent to them instead the teeth of scatha made into a necklace saying jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries for they are hard to come by some say that the dwarves slew fram for this insult there was no great love between йothйod and the dwarves lйod was the name of eorls father he was a tamer of wild horses for there were many at that time in the land he captured a white foal and it grew quickly to a horse strong and fair and proud no man could tame it when lйod dared to mount it it bore him away and at last threw him and lйods head struck a rock and so he died he was then only two and forty years old and his son a youth of sixteen eorl vowed that he would avenge his father he hunted long for the horse and at last he caught sight of him and his companions expected that he would try to come within bowshot and kill him but when they drew near eorl stood up and called in a loud voice come hither mansbane and get a new name to their wonder the horse looked towards eorl and came and stood before him and eorl said felarуf i name you you loved your freedom and i do not blame you for that but now you owe me a great weregild and you shall surrender your freedom to me until your lifes end then eorl mounted him and felarуf submitted and eorl rode him home without bit or bridle and he rode him in like fashion ever after the horse understood all that men said though he would allow no man but eorl to mount him it was upon felarуf that eorl rode to the field of celebrant for that horse proved as long lived as men and so were his descendants these were the mearas who would bear no one but the king of the mark or his sons until the time of shadowfax men said of them that bйma must have brought their sire from west over sea of the kings of the mark between eorl and thйoden most is said of helm hammerhand he was a grim man of great strength there was at that time a man named freca who claimed descent from king frйawine though he had men said much dunlendish blood and was darkhaired he grew rich and powerful having wide lands on either side of the adorn near its source he made himself a stronghold and paid little heed to the king helm mistrusted him but called him to his councils and he came when it pleased him to one of these councils freca rode with many men and he asked the hand of helms daughter for his son wulf but helm said you have grown big since you were last here but it is mostly fat i guess and men laughed at that for freca was wide in the belt then freca fell in a rage and reviled the king and said this at the last old kings that refuse a proffered staff may fall on their knees helm answered come the marriage of your son is a trifle let helm and freca deal with it later meanwhile the king and his council have matters of moment to consider when the council was over helm stood up and laid his great hand on frecas shoulder saying the king does not permit brawls in his house but men are freer outside and he forced freca to walk before him out from edoras into the field to frecas men that came up he said be off we need no hearers we are going to speak of a private matter alone go and talk to my men and they looked and saw that the kings men and his friends far outnumbered them and they drew back now dunlending said the king you have only helm to deal with alone and unarmed but you have said much already and it is my turn to speak freca your folly has grown with your belly you talk of a staff if helm dislikes a crooked staff that is thrust on him he breaks it so with that he smote freca such a blow with his fist that he fell back stunned and died soon after helm then proclaimed frecas son and near kin the kings enemies and they fled for at once helm sent many men riding to the west marches four years later great troubles came to rohan and no help could be sent from gondor for three fleets of the corsairs attacked it and there was war on all its coasts at the same time rohan was again invaded from the east and the dunlendings seeing their chance came over the isen and down from isengard it was soon known that wulf was their leader the were in great force for they were joined by enemies of gondor that landed in the mouths of lefnui and isen the rohirrim were defeated and their land was overrun and those who were not slain or enslaved fled to the dales of the mountains helm was driven back with great loss from the crossings of isen and took refuge in the hornburg and the ravine behind there he was besieged wulf took edoras and sat in meduseld and called himself king there haleth helms son fell last of all defending the doors soon afterwards the long winter began and rohan lay under snow for nearly five months both the rohirrim and their foes suffered grievously in the cold and in the dearth that lasted longer in helms deep there was a great hunger after yule and being in despair against the kings counsel hбma his younger son led men out on a sortie and foray but they were lost in the snow helm grew fierce and gaunt for famine and grief and the dread of him alone was worth many men in the defence of the burg he would go out by himself clad in white and stalk like a snowtroll into the camps of his enemies and slay many men with his hands it was believed that if he bore no weapon no weapon would bite on him the dunlendings said that if he could find no food he ate men that tale lasted long in dunland helm had a great horn and soon it was marked that before he sallied forth he would blow a blast upon it that echoed in the deep and then so great a fear fell on his enemies that instead of gathering to take him or kill him they fled away down the coomb one night men heard the horn blowing but helm did not return in the morning there came a sungleam the first for long days and they saw a white figure standing still on the dike alone for none of the dunlendings dared come near there stood helm dead as a stone but his knees were unbent yet men said that the horn was still heard at times in the deep and the wraith of helm would walk among the foes of rohan and kill men with fear soon after the winter broke then frйalбf son of hild helms sister came down out of dunharrow to which many had fled and with a small company of desperate men he surprised wulf in meduseld and slew him and regained edoras there were great floods after the snows and the vale of entwash became a vast fen the eastern invaders perished or withdrew and there came help at last from gondor by the roads both east and west of the mountains before the year was ended the dunlendings were driven out even from isengard and then frйalбf became king helm was brought from the hornburg and laid in the ninth mound ever after the white simbelmynл grew there most thickly so that the mound seemed to be snowclad when frйalбf died a new line of mounds was begun the rohirrim were grievously reduced by war and dearth and loss of cattle and horses and it was well that no great danger threatened them again for many years for it was not until the time of king folcwine that they recovered their former strength it was at the crowning of frйalбf that saruman appeared bringing gifts and speaking great praise of the valour of the rohirrim all thought him a welcome guest soon after he took up his abode in isengard for this beren steward of gondor gave him leave for gondor still claimed isengard as a fortress of its realm and not part of rohan beren also gave into sarumans keeping the keys of orthanc that tower no enemy had been able to harm or to enter in this way saruman began to behave as a lord of men for at first he held isengard as a lieutenant of the steward and warden of the tower but frйalбf was as glad as beren to have this so and to know that isengard was in the hands of a strong friend a friend he long seemed and maybe in the beginning he was one in truth though afterwards there was little doubt in mens minds that saruman went to isengard in hope to find the stone still there and with the purpose of building up a power of his own certainly after the last white council his designs towards rohan though he hid them were evil he then took isengard for his own and began to make it a place of guarded strength and fear as though to rival the baraddыr his friends and servants he drew then from all who hated gondor and rohan whether men or other creatures more evil the kings of the mark first line year eorl the young he was so named because he succeeded his father in youth and remained yellowhaired and ruddy to the end of his days these were shortened by a renewed attack of the easterlings eorl fell in battle in the wold and the first mound was raised felarуf was laid there also brego he drove the enemy out of the wold and rohan was not attacked again for many years in he completed the great hall of meduseld at the feast his son baldor vowed that he would tread the paths of the dead and did not return brego died of grief the next year aldor the old he was bregos second son he became known as the old since he lived to a great age and was king for years in his time the rohirrim increased and drove out or subdued the last of the dunlendish people that lingered east of isen harrowdale and other mountainvalleys were settled of the next three kings little is said for rohan had peace and prospered in their time frйa eldest son but fourth child of aldor he was already old when he became king frйawine goldwine dйor in his time the dunlendings raided often over the isen in they occupied the deserted ring of isengard and could not be dislodged gram helm hammerhand at the end of his reign rohan suffered great loss by invasion and the long winter helm and his sons haleth and hбma perished frйalбf helms sisters son became king second line year frйalбf hildeson in his time saruman came to isengard from which the dunlendings had been driven the rohirrim at first profited by his friendship in the days of dearth and weakness that followed brytta he was called by his people lйofa for he was loved by all he was openhanded and a help to all the needy in his time there was war with orcs that driven from the north sought refuges in the white mountains when he died it was thought that they had all been hunted out but it was not so walda he was king only nine years he was slain with all his companions when they were trapped by orcs as they rode by mountainpaths from dunharrow folca he was a great hunter but he vowed to chase no wild beast while there was an orc left in rohan when the last orchold was found and destroyed he went to hunt the great boar of everholt in the firien wood he slew the boar but died of the tuskwounds that it gave him folcwine when he became king the rohirrim had recovered their strength he reconquered the westmarch that dunlendings had occupied rohan had received great help from gondor in the evil days when therefore he heard that the haradrim were assailing gondor with great strength he sent many men to the help of the steward he wished to lead them himself but was dissuaded and his twin sons folcred and fastred went in his stead they fell side by side in battle in ithilien turin ii of gondor sent to folcwine a rich weregild of gold fengel he was the third son and fourth child of folcwine he is not remembered with praise he was greedy of food and of gold and at strife with his marshals and with his children thengel his third child and only son left rohan when he came to manhood and lived long in gondor and won honour in the service of turgon thengel he took no wife until late but in he wedded morwen of lossarnach in gondor though she was seventeen years the younger she bore him three children in gondor of whom thйoden the second was his only son when fengel died the rohirrim recalled him and he returned unwillingly but he proved a good and wise king though the speech of gondor was used in his house and not all men thought that good morwen bore him two more daughters in rohan and the last thйodwyn was the fairest though she came late the child of his age her brother loved her dearly it was soon after thengels return that saruman declared himself lord of isengard and began to give trouble to rohan encroaching on its borders and supporting its enemies thйoden he is called thйoden ednew in the lore of rohan for he fell into a decline under the spells of saruman but was healed by gandalf and in the last year of his life arose and led his men to victory at the hornburg and soon after to the fields of pelennor the greatest battle of the age he fell before the gates of mundburg for a while he rested in the land of his birth among the dead kings of gondor but was brought back and laid in the eighth mound of his line at edoras then a new line was begun third line in thйodwyn married йomund of eastfold the chief marshal of the mark her son йomer was born in and her daughter йowyn in at that time sauron had arisen again and the shadow of mordor reached out to rohan orcs began to raid in the eastern regions and slay or steal horses others also came down from the misty mountains many being great uruks in the service of saruman though it was long before that was suspected йomunds chief charge lay in the east marches and he was a great lover of horses and hater of orcs if news came of a raid he would often ride against them in hot anger unwarily and with few men thus it came about that he was slain in for he pursued a small band to the borders of the emyn muil and was there surprised by a strong force that lay in wait in the rocks not long after thйodwyn took sick and died to the great grief of the king her children he took into his house calling them son and daughter he had only one child of his own thйodred his son then twentyfour years old for the queen elfhild had died in childbirth and thйoden did not wed again йomer and йowyn grew up at edoras and saw the dark shadow fall on the halls of thйoden йomer was like his fathers before him but йowyn was slender and tall with a grace and pride that came her out of the south from morwen of lossarnach whom the rohirrim had called steelsheen fa йomer йadig when still young he became a marshal of the mark and was given his fathers charge in the east marches in the war of the ring thйodred fell in battle with saruman at the crossings of isen therefore before he died on the fields of the pelennor thйoden named йomer his heir and called him king in that day йowyn also won renown for she fought in that battle riding in disguise and was known after in the mark as the lady of the shieldarm йomer became a great king and being young when he succeeded thйoden he reigned for sixtyfive years longer than all their kings before him save aldor the old in the war of the ring he made the friendship of king elessar and of imrahil of dol amroth and he rode often to gondor in the last year of the third age he wedded lothнriel daughter of imrahil their son elfwine the fair ruled after him in йomers day in the mark men had peace who wished for it and the people increased both in the dales and the plains and their horses multiplied in gondor the king elessar now ruled and in arnor also in all the lands of those realms of old he was king save in rohan only for he renewed to йomer the gift of cirion and йomer took again the oath of eorl often he fulfilled it for though sauron had passed the hatreds and evils that he bred had not died and the king of the west had many enemies to subdue before the white tree could grow in peace and wherever king elessar went with war king йomer went with him and beyond the sea of rhыn and on the far fields of the south the thunder of the cavalry of the mark was heard and the white horse upon green flew in many winds until йomer grew old iii durins folk concerning the beginning of the dwarves strange tales are told both by the eldar and by the dwarves themselves but since these things lie far back beyond our days little is said of them here durin is the name that the dwarves used for the eldest of the seven fathers of their race and the ancestor of all the kings of the longbeards he slept alone until in the deeps of time and the awakening of that people he came to azanulbizar and in the caves above kheledzвram in the east of the misty mountains he made his dwelling where afterwards were the mines of moria renowned in song there he lived so long that he was known far and wide as durin the deathless yet in the end he died before the elder days had passed and his tomb was in khazaddыm but his line never failed and five times an heir was born in his house so like to his forefather that he received the name of durin he was indeed held by the dwarves to be the deathless that returned for they have many strange tales and beliefs concerning themselves and their fate in the world after the end of the first age the power and wealth of khazaddыm was much increased for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft when the ancient cities of nogrod and belegost in the blue mountains were ruined at the breaking of thangorodrim the power of moria endured throughout the dark years and the dominion of sauron for though eregion was destroyed and the gates of moria were shut the halls of khazaddыm were too deep and strong and filled with a people too numerous and valiant for sauron to conquer from without thus its wealth remained long unravished though its people began to dwindle it came to pass that in the middle of the third age durin was again its king being the sixth of that name the power of sauron servant of morgoth was then again growing in the world though the shadow in the forest that looked towards moria was not yet known for what it was all evil things were stirring the dwarves delved deep at that time seeking beneath barazinbar for mithril the metal beyond price that was becoming yearly ever harder to win thus they roused from sleep a thing of terror that flying from thangorodrim had lain hidden at the foundations of the earth since the coming of the host of the west a balrog of morgoth durin was slain by it and the year after nбin i his son and then the glory of moria passed and its people were destroyed or fled far away most of these that escaped made their way into the north and thrбin i nбins son came to erebor the lonely mountain near the eastern eaves of mirkwood and there he began new works and became king under the mountain in erebor he found the great jewel the arkenstone heart of the mountain but thorin i his son removed and went into the far north to the grey mountains where most of durins folk were now gathering for those mountains were rich and little explored but there were dragons in the wastes beyond and after many years they became strong again and multiplied and they made war on the dwarves and plundered their works at last dбin i together with frуr his second son was slain at the door of his hall by a great colddrake not long after most of durins folk abandoned the grey mountains grуr dбins son went away with many followers to the iron hills but thrуr dбins heir with borin his fathers brother and the remainder of the people returned to erebor to the great hall of thrбin thrуr brought back the arkenstone and he and his folk prospered and became rich and they had the friendship of all men that dwelt near for they made not only things of wonder and beauty but weapons and armour of great worth and there was great traffic of ore between them and their kin in the iron hills thus the northmen who lived between celduin and carnen became strong and drove back all enemies from the east and the dwarves lived in plenty and there was feasting and song in the halls of erebor so the rumour of the wealth of erebor spread abroad and reached the ears of the dragons and at last smaug the golden greatest of the dragons of his day arose and without warning came against king thrуr and descended on the mountain in flames it was not long before all that realm was destroyed and the town of dale near by was ruined and deserted but smaug entered into the great hall and lay there upon a bed of gold from the sack and the burning many of thrуrs kin escaped and last of all from the halls by a secret door came thrуr himself and his son thrбin ii they went away south with their family into long and homeless wandering with them went also a small company of their kinsmen and faithful followers years afterwards thrуr now old poor and desperate gave to his son thrбin the one great treasure he still possessed the last of the seven rings and then he went away with one old companion only called nбr of the ring he said to thrбin at their parting this may prove the foundation of new fortune for you yet though that seems unlikely but it needs gold to breed gold surely you do not think of returning to erebor said thrбin not at my age said thrуr our vengeance on smaug i bequeath to you and your sons but i am tired of poverty and the scorn of men i go to see what i can find he did not say where he was a little crazed perhaps with age and misfortune and long brooding on the splendour of moria in his forefathers days or the ring it may be was turning to evil now that its master was awake driving him to folly and destruction from dunland where he was then dwelling he went north with nбr and they crossed the redhorn pass and came down into azanulbizar when thrуr came to moria the gate was open nбr begged him to beware but he took no heed of him and walked proudly in as an heir that returns but he did not come back nбr stayed near by for many days in hiding one day he heard a loud shout and the blare of a horn and a body was flung out on the steps fearing that it was thrуr he began to creep near but there came a voice from within the gate come on beardling we can see you but there is no need to be afraid today we need you as a messenger then nбr came up and found that it was indeed the body of thrуr but the head was severed and lay face downwards as he knelt there he heard orclaughter in the shadows and the voice said if beggars will not wait at the door but sneak in to try thieving that is what we do to them if any of your people poke their foul beards in here again they will fare the same go and tell them so but if his family wish to know who is now king here the name is written on his face i wrote it i killed him i am the master then nбr turned the head and saw branded on the brow in dwarfrunes so that he could read it the name azog that name was branded in his heart and in the hearts of all the dwarves afterwards nбr stooped to take the head but the voice of azog said drop it be off heres your fee beggarbeard a small bag struck him it held a few coins of little worth weeping nбr fled down the silverlode but he looked back once and saw that orcs had come from the gate and were hacking up the body and flinging the pieces to the black crows such was the tale that nбr brought back to thrбin and when he had wept and torn his beard he fell silent seven days he sat and said no word then he stood up and said this cannot be borne that was the beginning of the war of the dwarves and the orcs which was long and deadly and fought for the most part in deep places beneath the earth thrбin at once sent messengers bearing the tale north east and west but it was three years before the dwarves had mustered their strength durins folk gathered all their host and they were joined by great forces sent from the houses of other fathers for this dishonour to the heir of the eldest of their race filled them with wrath when all was ready they assailed and sacked one by one all the strongholds of the orcs that they could from gundabad to the gladden both sides were pitiless and there was death and cruel deeds by dark and by light but the dwarves had the victory through their strength and their matchless weapons and the fire of their anger as they hunted for azog in every den under mountain at last all the orcs that fled before them were gathered in moria and the dwarfhost in pursuit came to azanulbizar that was a great vale that lay between the arms of the mountains about the lake of kheledzвram and had been of old part of the kingdom of khazaddыm when the dwarves saw the gate of their ancient mansions upon the hillside they sent up a great shout like thunder in the valley but a great host of foes was arrayed on the slopes above them and out of the gates poured a multitude of orcs that had been held back by azog for the last need at first fortune was against the dwarves for it was a dark day of winter without sun and the orcs did not waver and they outnumbered their enemies and had the higher ground so began the battle of azanulbizar at the memory of which the orcs still shudder and the dwarves weep the first assault of the vanguard led by thrбin was thrown back with loss and thrбin was driven into a wood of great trees that then still grew not far from kheledzвram there frerin his son fell and fundin his kinsman and many others and both thrбin and thorin were wounded elsewhere the battle swayed to and fro with great slaughter until at last the people of the iron hills turned the day coming late and fresh to the field the mailed warriors of nбin grуrs son drove through the orcs to the very threshold of moria crying azog azog as they hewed down with their mattocks all who stood in their way then nбin stood before the gate and cried with a great voice azog if you are in come out or is the play in the valley too rough thereupon azog came forth and he was a great orc with a huge ironclad head and yet agile and strong with him came many like him the fighters of his guard and as they engaged nбins company he turned to nбin and said what yet another beggar at my doors must i brand you too with that he rushed at nбin and they fought but nбin was half blind with rage and also very weary with battle whereas azog was fresh and fell and full of guile soon nбin made a great stroke with all his strength that remained but azog darted aside and kicked nбins leg so that the mattock splintered on the stone where he had stood but nбin stumbled forward then azog with a swift swing hewed his neck his mailcollar withstood the edge but so heavy was the blow that nбins neck was broken and he fell then azog laughed and he lifted up his head to let forth a great yell of triumph but the cry died in his throat for he saw that all his host in the valley was in a rout and the dwarves went this way and that slaying as they would and those that could escape from them were flying south shrieking as they ran and hard by all the soldiers of his guard lay dead he turned and fled back towards the gate up the steps after him leaped a dwarf with a red axe it was dбin ironfoot nбins son right before the doors he caught azog and there he slew him and hewed off his head that was held a great feat for dбin was then only a stripling in the reckoning of the dwarves but long life and many battles lay before him until old but unbowed he fell at last in the war of the ring yet hardy and full of wrath as he was it is said that when he came down from the gate he looked grey in the face as one who has felt great fear when at last the battle was won the dwarves that were left gathered in azanulbizar they took the head of azog and thrust into its mouth the purse of small money and then they set it on a stake but no feast nor song was there that night for their dead were beyond the count of grief barely half of their number it is said could still stand or had hope of healing none the less in the morning thrбin stood before them he bad one eye blinded beyond cure and he was halt with a legwound but he said good we have the victory khazaddыm is ours but they answered durins heir you may be but even with one eye you should see clearer we fought this war for vengeance and vengeance we have taken but it is not sweet if this is victory then our hands are too small to hold it and those who were not of durins folk said also khazaddыm was not our fathers house what is it to us unless a hope of treasure but now if we must go without the rewards and the weregilds that are owed to us the sooner we return to our own lands the better pleased we shall be then thrбin turned to dбin and said but surely my own kin will not desert me no said dбin you are the father of our folk and we have bled for you and will again but we will not enter khazaddыm you will not enter khazaddыm only i have looked through the shadow of the gate beyond the shadow it waits for you still durins bane the world must change and some other power than ours must come before durins folk walk again in moria so it was that after azanulbizar the dwarves dispersed again but first with great labour they stripped all their dead so that orcs should not come and win there a store of weapons and mail it is said that every dwarf that went from that battlefield was bowed under a heavy burden then they built many pyres and burned all the bodies of their kin there was a great felling of trees in the valley which remained bare ever after and the reek of the burning was seen in lуrien when the dreadful fires were in ashes the allies went away to their own countries and dбin ironfoot led his fathers people back to the iron hills then standing by the great stake thrбin said to thorin oakenshield some would think this head dearly bought at least we have given our kingdom for it will you come with me back to the anvil or will you beg your bread at proud doors to the anvil answered thorin the hammer will at least keep the arms strong until they can wield sharper tools again so thrбin and thorin with what remained of their following returned to dunland and soon afterwards they removed and wandered in eriador until at last they made a home in exile in the east of the ered luin beyond the lune of iron were most of the things that they forged in those days but they prospered after a fashion and their numbers slowly increased but as thrуr had said the ring needed gold to breed gold and of that or any other precious metal they had little or none of this ring something may be said here it was believed by the dwarves of durins folk to be the first of the seven that was forged and they say that it was given to the king of khazaddыm durin iii by the elvensmiths themselves and not by sauron though doubtless his evil power was on it since he had aided in the forging of all the seven but the possessors of the ring did not display it or speak of it and they seldom surrendered it until near death so that others did not know for certain where it was bestowed some thought that it had remained in khazaddыm in the secret tombs of the kings if they had not been discovered and plundered but among the kindred of durins heir it was believed that thrуr had worn it when he rashly returned there what then had become of it they did not know it was not found on the body of azog none the less it may well be as the dwarves now believe that sauron by his arts had discovered who had this ring the last to remain free and that the singular misfortunes of the heirs of durin were largely due to his malice for the dwarves had proved untameable by this means the only power over them that the rings wielded was to inflame their hearts with a greed of gold and precious things so that if they lacked them all other good things seemed profitless and they were filled with wrath and desire for vengeance on all who deprived them but they were made from their beginning of a kind to resist most steadfastly any domination though they could be slain or broken they could not be reduced to shadows enslaved to another will and for the same reason their lives were not affected by any ring to live either longer or shorter because of it all the more did sauron hate the possessors and desire to dispossess them it was therefore perhaps partly by the malice of the ring that thrбin after same years became restless and discontented the lust for gold was ever in his mind at last when he could endure it no longer he turned his thoughts to erebor and resolved to go back there he said nothing to thorin of what was in his heart but with balin and dwalin and a few others he arose and said farewell and departed little is known of what happened to him afterwards it would now seem that as soon as he was abroad with few companions he was hunted by the emissaries of sauron wolves pursued him orcs waylaid him evil birds shadowed his path and the more he strove to go north the more misfortunes opposed him there came a dark night when he and his companions were wandering in the land beyond anduin and they were driven by a black rain to take shelter under the eaves of mirkwood in the morning he was gone from the camp and his companions called him in vain they searched for him many days until at last giving up hope they departed and came at length back to thorin only long after was it learned that thrбin had been taken alive and brought to the pits of dol guldur there he was tormented and the ring taken from him and them at last he died so thorin oakenshield became the heir of durin but an heir without hope when thrбin was lost he was ninetyfive a great dwarf of proud bearing but he seemed content to remain in eriador there he laboured long and trafficked and gained such wealth as he could and his people were increased by many of the wandering folk of durin who heard of his dwelling in the west and came to him now they had fair halls in the mountains and store of goods and their days did not seem so hard though in their songs they spoke ever of the lonely mountain far away the years lengthened the embers in the heart of thorin grew hot again as he brooded on the wrongs of his house and the vengeance upon the dragon the he had inherited he thought of weapons and armies and alliances as his great hammer rang in his forge but the armies were dispersed and the alliances broken and the axes of his people were few and a great anger without hope burned him as he smote the red iron on the anvil but at last there came about by chance a meeting between gandalf and thorin that changed all the fortunes of the house of durin and led to other and greater ends beside on a time thorin returning west from a journey stayed at bree for the night there gandalf was also he was on his way to the shire which he had not visited for some twenty years he was weary and thought to rest there for a while among many cares he was troubled in mind by the perilous state of the north because he knew then already that sauron was plotting war and intended as soon as he felt strong enough to attack rivendell but to resist any attempt from the east to regain the lands of angmar and the northern passes in the mountains there were now only the dwarves of the iron hills and beyond them lay the desolation of the dragon the dragon sauron might use with terrible effect how then could the end of smaug be achieved it was even as gandalf sat and pondered this that thorin stood before him and said master gandalf i know you only by sight but now i should be glad to speak with you for you have often come into my thoughts of late as if i were bidden to seek you indeed i should have done so if i had known where to find you gandalf looked at him with wonder that is strange thorin oakenshield he said for i have thought of you also and though i am on my way to the shire it was in my mind that is the way also to your halls call them so if you will said thorin they are only poor lodgings in exile but you would be welcome there if you would come for they say that you are wise and know more than any other of what goes on in the world and i have much on my mind and would be glad of your counsel i will come said gandalf for i guess that we share one trouble at least the dragon of erebor is on my mind and i do not think that he will be forgotten by the grandson of thrуr the story is told elsewhere of what came of that meeting of the strange plan that gandalf made for the help of thorin and how thorin and his companions set out from the shire on the quest of the lonely mountain that came to great ends unforeseen here only those things are recalled that directly concern durins folk the dragon was slain by bard of esgaroth but there was battle in dale for the orcs came down upon erebor as soon as they heard of the return of the dwarves and they were led by bolg son of that azog whom dбin slew in his youth in that first battle of dale thorin oakenshield was mortally wounded and he died and was laid in a tomb under the mountain with the arkenstone upon his breast there fell also fнli and kнli his sistersons but dбin ironfoot his cousin who came from the iron hills to his aid and was also his rightful heir became then king dбin ii and the kingdom under the mountain was restored even as gandalf had desired dбin proved a great and wise king and the dwarves prospered and grew strong again in his day in the late summer of that same year gandalf had at last prevailed upon saruman and the white council to attack dol guldur and sauron retreated and went to mordor there to be secure as he thought from all his enemies so it was that when the war came at last the main assault was turned southwards yet even so with his farstretched right hand sauron might have done great evil in the north if king dбin and king brand had not stood in his path even as gandalf said afterwards to frodo and gimli when they dwelt together for a time in minas tirith not long before news had come to gondor of events far away i grieved at the fall of thorin said gandalf and now we hear that dбin has fallen fighting in dale again even while we fought here i should call that a heavy loss if it was not a wonder rather that in his great age he could still wield his axe as mightily as they say that he did standing over the body of king brand before the gate of erebor until the darkness fell yet things might have gone far otherwise and far worse when you think of the great battle of the pelennor do not forget the battles in dale and the valour of durins folk think of what might have been dragonfire and savage swords in eriador night in rivendell there might be no queen in gondor we might now hope to return from the victory here only to ruin and ash but that has been averted because i met thorin oakenshield one evening on the edge of spring in bree a chancemeeting as we say in middleearth dнs was the daughter of thrбin ii she is the only dwarfwoman named in these histories it was said by gimli that there are few dwarfwomen probably no more than a third of the whole people they seldom walk abroad except at great need they are in voice and appearance and in garb if they must go on a journey so like to the dwarfmen that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart this has given rise to the foolish opinion among men that there are no dwarfwomen and that the dwarves grow out of stone it is because of the fewness of women among them that the kind of the dwarves increases slowly and is in peril when they have no secure dwellings for dwarves take only one wife or husband each in their lives and are jealous as in all matters of their rights the number of dwarfmen that marry is actually less than onethird for not all the women take husbands some desire none some desire one that they cannot get and so will have no other as for the men very many also do not desire marriage being engrossed in their crafts foundation of erebor dбin i slain by a dragon return to erebor sack of erebor murder of thrуr mustering of the dwarves war of the dwarves and orcs battle of nanduhirion thrбin goes wandering death of thrбin and loss of his ring battle of five armies and death of thorin ii balin goes to moria the names of those who were held to be kings of durins folk whether in exile or not are marked so of the other companions of thorin oakenshield in the journey to erebor ori nori and dori were also of the house of durin and more remote kinsmen of thorin bifur bofur and bombur were descended from dwarves of moria but were not of durins line for see p gimli glуins son is renowned for he was one of the nine walkers that set out with the ring and he remained in the company of king elessar throughout the war he was named elffriend because of the great love that grew between him and legolas son of king thranduil and because of his reverence for the lady galadriel after the fall of sauron gimli brought south a part of the dwarffolk of erebor and he became lord of the glittering caves he and his people did great works in gondor and rohan for minas tirith they forged gates of mithril and steel to replace those broken by the witchking legolas his friend also brought south elves out of greenwood and they dwelt in ithilien and it became once again the fairest country in all the westlands but when king elessar gave up his life legolas followed at last the desire of his heart and sailed over sea here follows one of the last notes in the red book we have heard tell that legolas took gimli glуins son with him because of their great friendship greater than any that has been between elf and dwarf if this is true then it is strange indeed that a dwarf should be willing to leave middleearth for any love or that the eldar should receive him or that the lords of the west should permit it but it is said that gimli went also out of desire to see again the beauty of galadriel and it may be that she being mighty among the eldar obtained this grace for him more cannot be said of this matter appendix b the tale of years the first age ended with the great battle in which the host of valinor broke thangorodrim and overthrew morgoth then most of the noldor returned into the far west and dwelt in eressлa within sight of valinor and many of the sindar went over sea also the second age ended with the first overthrow of sauron servant of morgoth and the taking of the one ring the third age came to its end in the war of the ring but the fourth age was not held to have begun until master elrond departed and the time was come for the dominion of men and the decline of all other speakingpeoples in middleearth in the fourth age the earlier ages were often called the elder days but that name was properly given only to the days before the casting out of morgoth the histories of that time are not recorded here thesecond age these were the dark years for men of middleearth but the years of the glory of nъmenor of events in middleearth the records are few and brief and their dates are often uncertain in the beginning of this age many of the high elves still remained most of these dwelt in lindon west of the ered luin but before the building of the baraddыr many of the sindar passed eastward and some established realms in the forests far away where their people were mostly silvan elves thranduil king in the north of greenwood the great was one of these in lindon north of the lune dwelt gilgalad last heir of the kings of the noldor in exile he was acknowledged as high king of the elves of the west in lindon south of the lune dwelt for a time celeborn kinsman of thingol his wife was galadriel greatest of elven women she was sister of finrod felagund friendofmen once king of nargothrond who gave his life to save beren son of barahir later some of the noldor went to eregion upon the west of the misty mountains and near to the westgate of moria this they did because they learned that mithril had been discovered in moria the noldor were great craftsmen and less unfriendly to the dwarves than the sindar but the friendship that grew up between the people of durin and the elvensmiths of eregion was the closest that there has ever been between the two races celebrimbor was

were the fading years of the eldar for long they were at peace wielding the three rings while sauron slept and the one ring was lost but they attempted nothing new living in memory of the past the dwarves hid themselves in deep places guarding their hoards but when evil began to stir again and dragons reappeared one by one their ancient treasures were plundered and they became a wandering people moria for long remained secure but its numbers dwindled until many of its vast mansions became dark and empty the wisdom and the lifespan of the nъmenoreans also waned as they became mingled with lesser men when maybe a thousand years had passed and the first shadow had fallen on greenwood the great the istari or wizards appeared in middleearth it was afterwards said that they came out of the far west and were messengers sent to contest the power of sauron and to unite all those who had the will to resist him but they were forbidden to match his power with power or to seek to dominate elves or men by force and fear they came therefore in the shape of men though they were never young and aged only slowly and they had many powers of mind and hand they revealed their true names to few but used such names as were given to them the two highest of this order were called by the eldar curunнr the man of skill and mithrandir the grey pilgrim but by men in the north saruman and gandalf curunнr journeyed often into the east but dwelt at last in isengard mithrandir was closest in friendship with the eldar and wandered mostly in the west and never made for himself any lasting abode throughout the third age the guardianship of the three rings was known only to those who possessed them but at the end it became known that they had been held at first by the three greatest of the eldar gilgalad galadriel and cнrdan gilgalad before he died gave his ring to elrond cнrdan later surrendered his to mithrandir for cнrdan saw further and deeper than any other in middleearth and he welcomed mithrandir at the grey havens knowing whence he came and whither he would return take this ring master he said for your labours will be heavy but it will support you in the weariness that you have taken upon yourself for this is the ring of fire and with it you may rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill but as for me my heart is with the sea and i will dwell by the grey shores until

there himself though grievous harm was done to the fair woods on the borders the assaults were driven back and when the shadow passed celeborn came forth and led the host of lуrien over anduin in many boats they took dol guldur and galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits and the forest was cleansed in the north also there had been war and evil the realm of thranduil was invaded and there was long battle under the trees and great ruin of fire but in the end thranduil had the victory and on the day of the new year of the elves celeborn and thranduil met in the midst of the forest and they renamed mirkwood eryn lasgalen the wood of greenleaves thranduil took all the northern region as far as the mountains that rise in the forest for his realm and celeborn took the southern wood below the narrows and named it east lуrien all the wide forest between was given to the beornings and the woodmen but after the passing of galadriel in a few years celeborn grew weary of his realm and went to imladris to dwell with the sons of elrond in the greenwood the silvan elves remained untroubled but in lуrien there lingered sadly only a few of its former people and there was no longer light or song in caras galadhon at the same time as the great armies besieged minas tirith a host of the allies of sauron that had long threatened the borders of king brand crossed the river carnen and

ironfoot were slain and the easterlings had the victory but they could not take the gate and many both dwarves and men took refuge in erebor and there withstood a siege when news came of the great victories in the south then saurons northern army was filled with dismay and the besieged came forth and routed them and the remnant fled into the east and troubled dale no more then bard ii brands

midyears day every year began on the first day of the week saturday and ended on the last day of the week friday the midyears day and in leapyears the overlithe had no weekday name the lithe before midyears day was called lithe and the one after was called lithe the yule at the end of the year was yule and that at the beginning was yule the overlithe was a day of special holiday but it did not occur in any of the years important to the history of the great ring it occurred in the year of the famous harvest and wonderful summer and the merrymaking in that year is said to have been the greatest in memory or record the calendars the calendar in the shire differed in several features from ours the year no doubt was of the same length for long ago as those times are now reckoned in years and lives of men they were not very remote according to the memory of the earth it is recorded by the hobbits that they had no week when they were still a wandering people and though they had months governed more or less by the moon their keeping of dates and calculations of time were vague and inaccurate in the westlands of eriador when they had begun to settle down they adopted the kings reckoning of the dъnedain which was ultimately of eldarin origin but the hobbits of the shire introduced several minor alterations this calendar or shire reckoning as it was called was eventually adopted also in bree except for the shire usage of counting as year the year of the colonization of the shire it is often difficult to discover from old tales and traditions precise information about things which people knew well and took for granted in their own day but owing to their general interest in genealogy and to the interest in ancient history which the learned amongst them developed after the war of the ring the shirehobbits seem to have concerned themselves a good deal with dates and they even drew up complicated tables showing the relations of their own system with others i am not skilled in these matters and may have made many errors but at any rate the chronology of the crucial years sr is so carefully set out in the red book that there cannot be much doubt about days and times at that point it seems clear that the eldar in middleearth who had as samwise remarked more time at their disposal reckoned in long periods and the quenya word yйn often translated year really means of our years the eldar preferred to reckon in sixes and twelves as far as possible a day of the sun they called rй and reckoned from sunset to sunset the yйn contained days for ritual rather than practical purposes the eldar observed a week or enquiл of six days and the yйn contained of these enquier reckoned continuously throughout the period in middleearth the eldar also observed a short period or solar year called a coranar or sunround when considered more or less astronomically but usually called loa growth when the seasonal changes in vegetation were primarily considered as was usual with the elves generally the loa was broken up into periods that might be regarded either as long months or short seasons these no doubt varied in different regions but the hobbits only provide information concerning the calendar of imladris in that calendar there were six of these seasons of which the quenya names were tuilл lairл yбviл quellл hrнvл coirл which may be translated spring summer autumn fading winter stirring the sindarin names were ethuil laer iavas firith rhоw echuir fading was also called lasselanta leaffall or in sindarin narbeleth sunwaning lairл and hrнvл each contained days and the remainder each the loa began with yestarл the day immediately before tuilл and ended with mettarл the day immediately after coirл between yбviл and quellл were inserted three enderi or middledays this provided a year of days which was supplemented by doubling the enderi in every twelfth year how any resulting inaccuracy was dealt with is uncertain if the year was then of the same length as now the yйn would have been more than a day too long that there was an inaccuracy is shown by a note in the calendars of the red book to the effect that in the reckoning of rivendell the last year of every third yйn was shortened by three days the doubling of the three enderi due in that year was omitted but that has not happened in our time of the adjustment of any remaining inaccuracy there is no record the nъmenoreans altered these arrangements they divided the loa into shorter periods of more regular length and they adhered to the custom of beginning the year in midwinter which had been used by men of the northwest from whom they were derived in the first age later they also made their week one of days and they reckoned the day from sunrise to sunrise the nъmenorean system as used in nъmenor and in arnor and gondor until the end of the kings was called kings reckoning the normal year had days it was divided into twelve astar or months of which ten had days and two had the long astar were those on either side of the midyear approximately our june and july the first day of the year was called yestarл the middleday was called loлndл and the last day mettarл these days belonged to no month in every fourth year except the last of a century two enderi or middledays were substituted for the loлndл in nъmenor calculation started with sa the deficit caused by deducting day from the last year of a century was not adjusted until the last year of a millennium leaving a millennial deficit of hours minutes seconds this addition was made in nъmenor in sa after the downfall in sa the system was maintained by the exiles but it was much dislocated by the beginning of the third age with a new numeration sa became ta by making ta a leap year instead of ta more short year of only days was intruded causing a deficit of hours minutes seconds the millennial additions were made years late in ta and to reduce the errors so caused and the accumulation of the millennial deficits mardil the steward issued a revised calendar to take effect in ta after a special addition of days to which concluded ѕ millennia since the beginning of the nъmenorean system but this still left about hours deficit hador to added day though this deficiency had not quite reached that amount after that no more adjustments were made by the end of the third age after more years the deficit had not yet amounted to day the revised calendar introduced by mardil was called stewards reckoning and was adopted eventually by most of the users of the westron language except the hobbits the months were all of days and days outside the months were introduced between the third and fourth months and between the ninth and tenth these days outside the months yestarл tuilйrл loлndл yбviйrл and mettarл were holidays the hobbits were conservative and continued to use a form of kings reckoning adapted to fit their own customs their months were all equal and had days each but they had summerdays called in the shire the lithe or the lithedays between june and july the last day of the year and the first of the next year were called the yuledays the yuledays and the lithedays remained outside the months so that january was the second and not the first day of the year every fourth year except in the last year of the century there were four lithedays the lithedays and the yuledays were the chief holidays and time of feasting the additional litheday was added after midyears day and so the th day of the leapyears was called overlithe and was a day of special merrymaking in full yuletide was six days long including the last three and first three days of each year the shirefolk introduced one small innovation of their own which they called shirereform they found the shifting of the weekday names in relation to dates from year to year untidy and inconvenient so in the time of isengrim ii they arranged that the odd day which put the succession out should have no weekday name after that midyears day was known only by its name and belonged to no week in consequence of this reform the year always began on the first day of the week and ended on the last day and the same date in any one year had the same weekday name in all other years so that shirefolk no longer bothered to put the weekday in their letters or diaries they found this quite convenient at home but not so convenient if they ever travelled further than bree in the above notes as in the narrative i have used our modern names for both months and weekdays though of course neither the eldar nor the dъnedain nor the hobbits actually did so translation of the westron names seemed to be essential to avoid confusion while the seasonal implications of our names are more or less the same at any rate in the shire it appears however that midyears day was intended to correspond as nearly as possible to the summer solstice in that case the shire dates were actually in advance of ours by some ten days and our new years day corresponded more or less to the shire january in the westron the quenya names of the months were usually retained as the latin names are now widely used in alien languages they were narvinyл nйnimл sъlimл vнressл lуtessл nбrнл cermiл urimл yavanniл narqueliл hнsimл ringarл the sindarin names were narwain nнnui gwaeron gwirith lothron nуrui cerveth urui ivanneth narbeleth hithui girithron in this nomenclature the hobbits however both of the shire and of bree diverged from the westron usage and adhered to oldfashioned local names of their own which they seem to have picked up in antiquity from the men of the vales of anduin at any rate similar names were found in dale and rohan the meanings of these names devised by men had as a rule long been forgotten by the hobbits even in cases where they had originally known what their significance was and the forms of the names were much obscured in consequence math for instance at the end of some of them is a reduction of month the shire names are set out in the calendar it may bc noted that solmath was usually pronounced and sometimes written somath thrimidge was often written thrimich and blotmath was pronounced blodmath or blommath in bree the names differed being frery solmath rethe chithing thrimidge lithe the summerdays mede wedmath harvestmath wintring blooting and yulemath frery chithing and yulemath were also used in the eastfarthing the hobbit week was taken from the dъnedain and the names were translations of those given to the days in the old northkingdom which in their turn were derived from the eldar the sixday week of the eldar had days dedicated to or named after the stars the sun the moon the two trees the heavens and the valar or powers in that order the last day being the chief day of the week their names in quenya were elenya anarya isilya aldъya menelya valanya the sindarin names were orgilion oranor orithil orgaladhad ormenel orbelain the nъmenoreans retained the dedications and order but altered the fourth day to aldлa with reference to the white tree only of which nimloth that grew in the kings court in nъmenor was believed to be a descendant also desiring a seventh day and being great mariners they inserted a seaday eдrenya after the heavens day the hobbits took over this arrangement but the meanings of their translated names were soon forgotten or no longer attended to and the forms were much reduced especially in everyday pronunciation the first translation of the nъmenorean names was probably made two thousand years or more before the end of the third age when the week of the dъnedain was taken up by men in the north as with their names of months the hobbits adhered to these translations although elsewhere in the westron area the quenya names were used not many ancient documents were preserved in the shire at the end of the third age far the most notable survival was yellowskin or the yearbook of tuckborough its earliest entries seem to have begun at least nine hundred years before frodos time and many are cited in the red book annals and genealogies in these the weekday names appear in archaic forms of which the following are the oldest sterrendei sunnendei monendei trewesdei hevenesdei meresdei highdei in the language of the time of the war of the ring these had become sterday sunday monday trewsday hevensday mersday highday i have translated these names also into our own names naturally beginning with sunday and monday which occur in the shire week with the same names as ours and renaming the others in order it must be noted however that the associations of the names were quite different in the shire the last day of the week friday was the chief day and one of holiday and evening feasts saturday thus corresponds more nearly to our monday and thursday to our saturday a few other names may be mentioned that have a reference to time though not used in precise reckonings the seasons usually named were tuilл spring lairл summer yбviл autumn hrнvл winter but these had no exact definitions and quellл was also used for the latter part of autumn and the beginning of winter the eldar paid special attention to the twilight chiefly as the times of starfading and staropening they had many names for these periods of which the most usual were tindуmл and undуmл the former most often referred to the time near dawn and undуmл to the evening the sindarin name was uial which could be defined as minuial and aduial these were often called in the shire morrowdim and evendim cf lake evendim as a translation of nenuial the shire reckoning and dates are the only ones of importance for the narrative of the war of the ring all the days months and dates are in the red book translated into shire terms or equated with them in notes the months and days therefore throughout the lord of the rings refer to the shire calendar the only points in which the differences between this and our calendar are important to the story at the crucial period the end of and the beginning of are these october has only days january is the second day of and february has days so that march the date of the downfall of the baraddыr would correspond to our march if our years began at the same seasonal point the date was however march in both kings and stewards reckoning the new reckoning was begun in the restored kingdom in ta it represented a return to kings reckoning adapted to fit a springbeginning as in the eldarin loa in the new reckoning the year began on march old style in commemoration of the fall of sauron and the deeds of the ringbearers the months retained their former names beginning now with vнressл but referred to periods beginning generally five days earlier than previously all the months had days there were enderi or middledays between yavanniл and narqueliл that corresponded with september old style but in honour of frodo yavanniл which corresponded with former september his birthday was made a festival and the leapyear was provided for by doubling this feast called cormarл or ringday the fourth age was held to have begun with the departure of master elrond which took place in september but for purposes of record in the kingdom fourth age was the year that began according to the new reckoning in march old style this reckoning was in the course of the reign of king elessar adopted in all his lands except the shire where the old calendar was retained and shire reckoning was continued fourth age was thus called and in so far as the hobbits took any account of the change of age they maintained that it began with yule and not in the previous march there is no record of the shirefolk commemorating either march or september but in the westfarthing especially in the country round hobbiton hill there grew a custom of making holiday and dancing in the party field when weather permitted on april some said that it was old sam gardners birthday some that it was the day on which the golden tree first flowered in and some that it was the elves new year in the buckland the horn of the mark was blown at sundown every november and bonfires and feastings followed appendix e writing and spelling i pronunciation of words and names the westron or common speech has been entirely translated into english equivalents an hobbit names and special words are intended to be pronounced accordingly for example bolger has g as in bulge and mathom rhymes with fathom in transcribing the ancient scripts i have tried to represent the original sounds with fair accuracy and at the same time to produce words and names that do not look uncouth in modern letters the highelven quenya has been spelt as much like latin as its sounds allowed for this reason c has been preferred to k m both eldarin languages the following points may be observed by those who are interested in such details c o n s o n a n t s c has always the value of k even before e and i celeb silver should be pronounced as keleb ch is only used to represent the sound heard in bach not that in english church except at the end of words and before t this sound was weakened to h in the speech of gondor and that change has been recognized in a few names such as rohan rohirrim dh represents the voiced th of english these clothes it is usually related to d as in s galadh tree compared with q alda but is sometimes derived from nr as in caradhras redhorn from caranrass f represents f except at the end of words where it is used to represent the sound of v as in english of nindalf fladrif g has only the sound of g in give get gil star in gildor gilraen osgiliath begins as in english gild h standing alone with no other consonant has the sound of h in house behold the quenya combination ht has the sound of cht as in german echt acht eg in the name telumehtar orion see also ch do l r th w y i initially before another vowel has the consonantal sound of y in you yore in sindarin only as in ioreth iarwain see y k is used in names drawn from other than elvish languages with the same value as c kh thus represents the same sound as ch in orkish grishnбkh or adыnaic adыnakhфr on dwarvish see p l represents more or less the sound of english initial l as in let it was however to some degree palatalized between e i and a consonant or finally after e i lh represents this sound when voiceless in quenya this is written hl but was in the third age usually pronounced as l ng represents ng in finger except finally where it was sounded as in english sing the latter sound also occurred initially in quenya but has been transcribed n according to the pronunciation of the third age ph has the same sound as f it is used where the fsound occurs at the end of a word as in alph swan where the fsound is related to or derived from a p as in ipheriannath the halflings in the middle of a few words where it represents a long ff as in ephel outer fence and in adыnaic as in arpharazфn qu has been used for cw a combination very frequent in quenya though it did not occur in sindarin r represents a trilled r in all positions the sound was not lost before consonants the orcs and some dwarves are said to have used a back or uvular r a sound which the eldar found distasteful rh represents a voiceless r it was written hr in quenya cf l s is always voiceless as in english so geese the zsound did not occur in contemporary quenya or sindarin sh occurring in dwarvish and orkish represents sounds similar to sh in english th represents the voiceless th of english in thin cloth this had become in quenya spoken s though still written with a different letter as in q isil s ithil moon ty represents a sound probably similar to the t in english tune it was derived mainly from c or ty the sound of english ch which was frequent in westron was usually substituted for it by speakers of that language cf hy under y v has the sound of english v but is not used finally see f w has the sound of english w hw is a voiceless w as in english white it was not an uncommon initial sound in quenya though examples seem not to occur in this book both v and w are used in the transcription of quenya in spite of the assimilation of its spelling to latin since the two sounds distinct in origin both occurred in the language y is used in quenya for the consonant y as in english you in sindarin y is a vowel hy has the same relation to y as hw to w and represents a sound like that heard in english hew huge h in quenya eht iht had the same sound the sound of english sh which was common in westron was often substituted by speakers of that language cf ty above hy was usually derived from sy and khy in both cases related sindarin words show initial h as in q hyarmen south s harad note that consonants written twice as tt ll ss nn represent long or double consonants at the end of words of more than one syllable these were usually shortened as in rohan from rochann in sindarin the combinations ng nd mb which were specially favoured in the eldarin languages at an earlier stage suffered various changes mb became m in all cases but still counted as a long consonant for purposes of stress and is thus written mm in cases where otherwise the stress might be in doubt ng remained unchanged except finally where it became the simple nasal nd became nn usually as ennor middleearth q endуre but remained nd at the end of fully accented monosyllables such as thond root and also before r as andros longfoam this nd is also seen in some ancient names derived from an older period such as nargothrond gondolin beleriand in the third age final nd in long words had become n from nn as in ithilien rohan anorien v o w e l s for vowels the letters i e a o u are used and y as far as can be determined the sounds represented by these letters were of normal kind though doubtless many local varieties escape detection that is the sounds were approximately those represented by i e a o h in english machine were father for brute irrespective of quantity in sindarin long e a o had the same quality as the short vowels being derived in comparatively recent times from them in quenya long к and у were when correctly pronounced as by the eldar tenser and closer than the short vowels sindarin alone among contemporary languages possessed the modified or fronted u more or less as u in french lune it was partly a modification of o and u partly derived from older diphthongs eu iu for this sound y has been used as in lyg snake q leuca or emyn pl of amon hill in condor this y was usually pronounced like i long vowels are usually marked with the acute accent as in some varieties of fлanorian script in sindarin long vowels in stressed monosyllables are marked with the circumflex since they leaded in such cases to be specially prolonged so in dыn compared with dъnadan the use of the circumflex in other languages such as adыnaic or dwarvish has no special significance and is used merely to mark these out as alien tongues final e is never mute or a mere sign of length as in english to mark this final e it is often written лthe groups er ir ur are not intended to be pronounced as in english fern fir fur but rather is english air eer oorin quenya ui oi ai and iu eu au are diphthongs all other pairs of vowels are dissyllabic this is often indicated by writing лa лo oл in sindarin the diphthongs are written ae oi ei oe ui and au other combinations are not diphthongal the writing of final au as aw is in accordance with english custom but is actually not uncommon in fлanorian spellings all these diphthongs were falling diphthongs that to stressed on the first element and composed of the simple vowels run together thus ai ei oi ui are intended to be pronounced respectively as the vowels in english rye grey boy ruin and au as in loud how and not as in laud haw there is nothing in english closely corresponding to ae oe eu ae and oe may be pronounced as ai oi s t r e s s the position of the accent or stress is not marked since in the eldarin languages concerned its place is determined by the form of the word in words of two syllables it falls in practically all cases on the first syllable in longer words it falls on the last syllable but one where that contains a long vowel a diphthong or a vowel followed by two consonants where the last syllable but one contains a short vowel followed by only one consonant the stress falls on the syllable before it the third from the end words of the last form are favoured in the eldarin languages especially quenya in the following examples the stressed vowel is marked by a capital letter isildur orome eressлa fлanor ancalima elentбri denethor periannath ecthelion pelargir silivren words of the type elentбri starqueen seldom occur in quenya where the vowel is й б o unless they are compounds they are commoner with the vowels н ъ as andъne sunset west they do not occur in sindarin except in compounds note that sindarin dh th ch are single consonants and represent single letters in the original scripts n o t e in names drawn from other languages than eldarin the same values for the letters are intended where not specially described above except in the case of dwarvish in dwarvish which did not possess the sounds represented above by th and ch th and kh are aspirates that is t or k followed by an h more or less as in backhand outhouse where z occurs the sound intended is that of english z gh in the black speech and orcish represents a back spirant as in ghвsh and agh the outer or mannish names of the dwarves have been given northern forms but the lettervalues are those described so also in the case of the personal and placenames of rohan except that here йa and йo are diphthongs which may be represented by the ea of english bear and the eo of theobald y is the modified u the modernized forms are easily recognized and are intended to be pronounced as in english they are mostly placenames as dunharrow except shadowfax and wormtongue ii writing the scripts and letters used in the third age were all ultimately of eldarin origin and already at that time of great antiquity they had reached the stage of full alphabetic development but older modes in which only the consonants were denoted by full letters were still in use the alphabets were of two main and in origin independent kinds the tengwar or tоw here translated as letters and the certar or cirth translated as runes the tengwar were devised for writing with brush or pen and the squared forms of inscriptions were in their case derivative from the written forms the certar were devised and mostly used only for scratched or incised inscriptions the tengwar were the more ancient for they had been developed by the noldor the kindred of the eldar most skilled in such matters long before their exile the oldest eldarin letters the tengwar of rъmil were not used in middleearth the later letters the tengwar of fлanor were largely a new invention though they owed something to the letters of rъmil they were brought to middleearth by the exiled noldor and so became known to the edain and nъmenoreans in the third age their use had spread over much the same area as that in which the common speech was known the cirth were devised first in beleriand by the sindar and were long used only for inscribing names and brief memorials upon wood or stone to that origin they owe their angular shapes very similar to the runes of our times though they differed from these in details and were wholly different in arrangement the cirth in their older and simpler form spread eastward in the second age and became known to many peoples to men and dwarves and even to orcs all of whom altered them to suit their purposes and according to their skill or lack of it one such simple form was still used by the men of dale and a similar one by the rohirrim but in beleriand before the end of the first age the cirth partly under the influence of the tengwar of the noldor were rearranged and further developed their richest and most ordered form was known as the alphabet of daeron since in elvish tradition it was said to have been devised by daeron the minstrel and loremaster of king thingol of doriath among the eldar the alphabet of daeron did not develop true cursive forms since for writing the elves adopted the fлanorian letters the elves of the west indeed for the most part gave up the use of runes altogether in the country of eregion however the alphabet of daeron was maintained in use and passed thence to moria where it became the alphabet most favoured by the dwarves it remained ever after in use among them and passed with them to the north hence in later times it was often called angerthas moria or the long runerows of moria as with their speech the dwarves made use of such scripts as were current and many wrote the fлanorian letters skilfully but for their own tongue they adhered to the cirth and developed written penforms from them the tengwar i ii iii iv q a z t h e fл a n o r i a n l e t t e r s the table shows in formal bookhand shape all the letters that were commonly used in the westlands in the third age the arrangement is the one most usual at the time and the one in which the letters were then usually recited by name this script was not in origin an alphabet that is a haphazard series of letters each with an independent value of its own recited in a traditional order that has no reference either to their shapes or to their functions it was rather a system of consonantal signs of similar shapes and style which could be adapted at choice or convenience to represent the consonants of languages observed by the eldar none of the letters had in itself a fixed value but certain relations between them were gradually recognized the system contained twentyfour primary letters arranged in four tйmar each of which had six tyeller there were also additional letters of which are examples of these and are the only strictly independent letters the remainder are modifications of other letters there was also a number of tehtar of varied uses these do not appear in the table the primary letters were each formed of a telco and a lъva the forms seen in were regarded as normal the stem could be raised as in or reduced as in the bow could be open as in series i and iii or closed as in ii and iv and in either case it could be doubled as eg in the theoretic freedom of application had in the third age been modified by custom to this extent that series i was generally applied to the dental or tseries and ii to the labials or pseries the application of series iii and iv varied according to the requirements of different languages in languages like the westron which made much use of consonants such as our ch j sh series iii was usually applied to these in which case series iv was applied to the normal kseries in quenya which possessed besides the calmatйma both a palatal series and labialized series the palatals were represented by a fлanorian diacritic denoting following y while series iv was a kwseries within these general applications the following relations were also commonly observed the normal letters grade were applied to the voiceless stops t p k etc the doubling of the bow indicated the addition of voice thus if t p ch k then d b j g the raising of the stem indicated the opening of the consonants to a spirant thus assuming the above values for grade grade th f sh ch and grade dh v zh gh the original fлanorian system also possessed a grade with extended stems both above and below the line these usually represented aspirated consonants but might represent other consonantal variations required they were not needed in the languages of the third age that used this script but the extended forms were much used as variants of grades and grade was usually applied to the nasal consonants thus and were the most common signs for n and m according to the principle observed above grade should then have represented the voiceless nasals but since such sounds were of very rare occurrence in the languages concerned grade was most often used for the weakest or semivocalic consonants of each series it consisted of the smallest and simplest shapes among the primary letters thus was often used for a weak r originally occurring in quenya and regarded in the system of that language as the weakest consonant of the tincotйma was widely used for w where series iii was used as a palatal series was commonly used as consonantal y since some of the consonants of grade tended to become weaker in pronunciation and to approach or to merge with those of grade many of the latter ceased to have a clear function in the eldarin languages and it was from these letters that the letters expressing vowels were largely derived n o t e the standard spelling of quenya diverged from the applications of the letters above described grade was used for nd mb ng ngw all of which were frequent since b g gw only appeared in these combinations while for rd ld the special letters were used similarly grade was used for the extremely frequent combinations nt mp nk nqu since quenya did not possess dh gh ghw and for v used letter see the quenya letternames pp the additional letters no was universally used for l no was used for full trilled r nos were modifications of these they were frequently used for voiceless r and l respectively but in quenya they were used for rd and ld represented s and z in those languages that required it the inverted forms and though available for use as separate signs were mostly used as mere variants of and according to the convenience of writing eg they were much used when accompanied by superimposed tehtar no was in origin a variation representing some variety of its most frequent use in the third age was h was mostly used for voiceless w and were when used as consonants mostly applied to у and w respectively the vowels were in many modes represented by tehtar usually set above a consonantal letter in languages such as quenya in which most words ended in a vowel the tehta was placed above the preceding consonant in those such as sindarin in which most words ended in a consonant it was placed above the following consonant when there was no consonant present in the required position the tehta was placed above the short carrier of which a common form was like an undotted i the actual tehtar used in different languages for vowelsigns were numerous the commonest usually applied to e i a o u are exhibited in the examples given the three dots most usual in forming writing for a were variously written in quicker styles a form like a circumflex being often employed the single dot and the acute accent were frequently used for i and e the curls were used for о and u in the ringinscription the curl open to the right is used for u but on the titlepage this stands for o and the curl open to the left for u the curl to the right was favoured and the application depended on the language concerned in the black speech о was rare long vowels were usually represented by placing the tehta on the long carrier of which a common form was like an undotted j but for the same purpose the tehtar could be doubled this was however only frequently done with the curls and sometimes with the accent two dots was more often used as a sign for following y the westgate inscription illustrates a mode of full writing with the vowels represented by separate letters all the vocalic letters used in sindarin are shown the use of no as a sign for vocalic у may be noted also the expression of diphthongs by placing the tehta for following у above the vowelletter the sign for following w was in this mode the ucurl or a modification of it but the diphthongs were often written out in full as in the transcription in this mode length of vowel was usually indicated by the acute accent called in that case andaith long mark there were beside the tehtar already mentioned a number of others chiefly used to abbreviate the writing especially by expressing frequent consonant combinations without writing them out in full among these a bar placed above a consonant was often used to indicate that it was preceded by the nasal of the same series a similar sign placed below was however mainly used to show that the consonant was long or doubled a downward hook attached to the bow was used to indicate a following s especially in the combinations ts ps ks that were favoured in quenyathere was of course no mode for the representation of english one adequate phonetically could be devised from the fлanorian system the brief example on the titlepage does not attempt to exhibit this it is rather an example of what a man of gondor might have produced hesitating between the values of the letters familiar in his mode and the traditional spelling of english it may be noted that a dot below is here employed in the representation of unstressed and but is also used in here for silent final e the of and of the are expressed by abbreviations the names of the letters in all modes each letter and sign had a name but these names were devised to fit or describe the phonetic uses in each particular mode it was however often felt desirable especially in describing the uses of the letters in other modes to have a name for each letter in itself as a shape for this purpose the quenya full names were commonly employed even where they referred to uses peculiar to quenya each full name was an actual word in quenya that contained the letter in question where possible it was the first sound of the word but where the sound or the combination expressed did not occur initially it followed immediately after an initial vowel the names of the letters in the table were tinco metal parma book calma lamp quesse feather ando gate umbar fate anga iron ungwe spiders web

are variants this is due to the names being given before certain changes that affected quenya as spoken by the exiles thus no was called harma when it represented the spirant ch in all positions but when this sound became breath h initially the name aha was devised бre was originally бze but when this z became merged with the sign was in quenya used for the very frequent ss of that language and the name esse was given to it hwesta sindarinwa or greyelven hw was so called because in quenya had the sound of hw and distinct signs for chw and hw were not required the names of the letters most widely known and used were n hy r f nъmen hyarmen rуmen formen west south east north these letters commonly indicated the points w s e n even in languages that used quite different terms they were in the westlands named in this order beginning with and facing west hyarmen and formen indeed meant lefthand region and righthand region the cirth the certhas daeron was originally devised to represent the sounds of sindarin only the oldest cirth were nos and a certh varying between and the assignment of values was unsystematic nos were vowels and remained so in all later developments nos were used for h or s according as was used for s or h this tendency to hesitate in the assignment of values for s and h continued in later arrangements in those characters that consisted of a stem and a branch the attachment of the branch was if on one side only usually made on the right side the reverse was not infrequent but had no phonetic significancethe extension and elaboration of this certhas was called in its older form the angerthas daeron since the additions to the old cirth and their reorganization was attributed to daeron the principal additions however the introductions of two new series and were actually most probably inventions of the noldor of eregion since they were used for the representation of sounds not found in sindarin the angerthas p b f v р in the rearrangement of the angerthas the following principles are observable adding a stroke to a branch added voice reversing the certh indicated opening to a spirant placing the branch on both sides of the stem added voice and nasality these principles were regularly carried out except in one point for sindarin a sign for a spirant m was required and since this could best be provided by a reversal of the sign for m the reversible no was given the value m but no was given the value hw no the theoretic value of which was z was used in spelling sindarin or quenya for ss cf fлanorian no was used for either i or у were used indifferently for s and was used for the frequent sequence nd though it was not clearly related in shape to the dentals in the table of values those on the left are when separated by the values of the older angerthas those on the right are the values of the dwarvish angerthas moria the dwarves of moria as can be seen introduced a number of unsystematic changes in value as well as certain new cirth the dislocation in values was due mainly to two causes the alteration in the values of respectively to h and s the abandonment of the nos for which the dwarves substituted the consequent use of for r the invention of for n the use of as z to go with in its value s and the consequent use of as n and the new certh for ng may also be observed the new were in origin a halved form of and were used for vowels like those heard in english butter which were frequent in dwarvish and in the westron when weak or evanescent they were often reduced to a mere stroke without a stem this angerthas moria is represented in the tombinscription the dwarves of erebor used a further modification of this system known as the mode of erebor and exemplified in the book of mazarbul its chief characteristics were the use of as z of as ks and the invention of two new cirth for ps and ts they also reintroduced for the values j zh but used for g gh or as mere variants of these peculiarities are not included in the table except for the special ereborian cirth appendix f i the languages and peoples of the third age the language represented in this history by english was the westron or common speech of the westlands of middleearth in the third age in the course of that age it had become the native language of nearly all the speakingpeoples who dwelt within the bounds of the old kingdoms of arnor and gondor that is along all the coasts from umbar northwards to the bay of forochel and inland as far as the misty mountains and the ephel dъath it had also spread north up the anduin occupying the lands west of the river and east of the mountains as far as the gladden fields at the time of the war of the ring at the end of the age these were still its bounds as a native tongue though large parts of eriador were now deserted and few men dwelt on the shore of the anduin between the gladden and rauros a few of the ancient wild men still lurked in the drъadan forest in anуrien and in the hills of dunland a remnant lingered of an old people the former inhabitants of much of gondor these clung to their own languages while in the plains of rohan there dwelt now a northern people the rohirrim who had come into that land some five hundred years earlier but the westron was used as a second language of intercourse by all those who still retained a speech of their own even by the elves not only in arnor and gondor but throughout the vales of anduin and eastward to the further eaves of mirkwood even among the wild men and the dunlendings who shunned other folk there were some that could speak it though brokenly of the elves the elves far back in the elder days became divided into two main branches the westelves and the eastelves of the latter kind were most of the elvenfolk of mirkwood and lуrien but their languages do not appear in this history in which all the elvish names and words are of eldarin form of the eldarin tongues two are found in this book the highelven or quenya the greyelven or sindarin the highelven was an ancient tongue of eldamar beyond the sea the first to be recorded in writing it was no longer a birthtongue but had become as it were an elvenlatin still used for ceremony and for high matters of lore and song by the high elves who had returned in exile to middleearth at the end of the first age the greyelven was in origin akin to quenya for it was the language of those eldar who coming to the shores of middleearth had not passed over the sea but had lingered on the coasts in the country of beleriand there thingol greycloak of doriath was their king and in the long twilight their tongue had changed with the changefulness of mortal lands and had become far estranged from the speech of the eldar from beyond the sea the exiles dwelling among the more numerous greyelves had adopted the sindarin for daily use and hence it was the tongue of all those elves and elflords that appear in this history for these were all of eldarin race even where the folk that they ruled were of the lesser kindreds noblest of all was the lady galadriel of the royal house of finarfin and sister of finrod felagund king of nargothrond in the hearts of the exiles the yearning for the sea was an unquiet never to be stilled in the hearts of the greyelves it slumbered but once awakened it could not be appeased of men the westron was a mannish speech though enriched and softened under elvish influence it was in origin the language of those whom the eldar called the atani or edain fathers of men being especially the people of the three houses of the elffriends who came west into beleriand in the first age and aided the eldar in the war of the great jewels against the dark power of the north after the overthrow of the dark power in which beleriand was for the most part drowned or broken it was granted as a reward to the elffriends that they also as the eldar might pass west over sea but since the undying realm was forbidden to them a great isle was set apart for them most westerly of all mortal lands the name of that isle was nъmenor most of the elffriends therefore departed and dwelt in nъmenor and there they became great and powerful mariners of renown and lords of many ships they were fair of face and tall and the span of their lives was thrice that of the men of middleearth these were the nъmenoreans the kings of men whom the elves called the dъnedain the dъnedain alone of all races of men knew and spoke an elvish tongue for their forefathers had learned the sindarin tongue and this they handed on to their children as a matter of lore changing little with the passing of the years and their men of wisdom learned also the highelven quenya and esteemed it above all other tongues and in it they made names for many places of fame and reverence and for many men of royalty and great renown but the native speech of the nъmenoreans remained for the most part their ancestral mannish tongue the adыnaic and to this in the latter days of their pride their kings and lords returned abandoning the elvenspeech save only those few that held still to their ancient friendship with the eldar in the years of their power the nъmenoreans had maintained many forts and havens upon the western coasts of middleearth for the help of their ships and one of the chief of these was at pelargir near the mouths of anduin there adыnaic was spoken and mingled with many words of the languages of lesser men it became a common speech that spread thence along the coasts among all that had dealings with westernesse after the downfall of nъmenor elendil led the survivors of the elffriends back to the northwestern shores of middleearth there many already dwelt who were in whole or part of nъmenorean blood but few of them remembered the elvish speech all told the dъnedain were thus from the beginning far fewer in number than the lesser men among whom they dwelt and whom they ruled being lords of long life and great power and wisdom they used therefore the common speech in their dealing with other folk and in the government of their wide realms but they enlarged the language and enriched it with many words drawn from the elventongues in the days of the nъmenorean kings this ennobled westron speech spread far and wide even among their enemies and it became used more and more by the dъnedain themselves so that at the time of the war of the ring the elventongue was known to only a small part of the peoples of gondor and spoken daily by fewer these dwelt mostly in minas tirith and the townlands adjacent and in the land of the tributary princes of dol amroth yet the names of nearly all places and persons in the realm of gondor were of elvish form and meaning a few were of forgotten origin and descended doubtless from days before the ships of the nъmenoreans sailed the sea among these were umbar arnach and erech and the mountainnames eilenach and rimmon forlong was also a name of the same sort most of the men of the northern regions of the westlands were descended from the edain of the first age or from their close kin their languages were therefore related to the adыnaic and some still preserved a likeness to the common speech of this kind were the peoples of the upper vales of anduin the beornings and the woodmen of western mirkwood and further north and east the men of the long lake and of dale from the lands between the gladden and the carrock came the folk that were known in gondor as the rohirrim masters of horses they still spoke their ancestral tongue and gave new names in it to nearly all the places in their new country and they called themselves the eorlings or the men of the riddermark but the lords of that people used the common speech freely and spoke it nobly after the manner of their allies in gondor for in gondor whence it came the westron kept still a more gracious and antique style wholly alien was the speech of the wild men of drъadan forest alien too or only remotely akin was the language of the dunlendings these were a remnant of the peoples that had dwelt in the vales of the white mountains in ages past the dead men of dunharrow were of their kin but in the dark years others had removed to the southern dales of the misty mountains and thence some had passed into the empty lands as far north as the barrowdowns from them came the men of bree but long before these had become subjects of the north kingdom of arnor and had taken up the westron tongue only in dunland did men of this race hold to their old speech and manners a secret folk unfriendly to the dъnedain hating the rohirrim of their language nothing appears in this book save the name forgoil which they gave to the rohirrim dunland and dunlending are the names that the rohirrim gave to them because they were swarthy and darkhaired there is thus no connexion between the word dunn in these names and the greyelven word dыn west of hobbits the hobbits of the shire and of bree had at this time for probably a thousand years adopted the common speech they used it in their own manner freely and carelessly though the more learned among them had still at their command a more formal language when occasion required there is no record of any language peculiar to hobbits in ancient days they seem always to have used the languages of men near whom or among whom they lived thus they quickly adopted the common speech after they entered eriador and by the time of their settlement at bree they had already begun to forget their former tongue this was evidently a mannish language of the upper anduin akin to that of the rohirrim though the southern stoors appear to have adopted a language related to dunlendish before they came north to the shire of these things in the time of frodo there were still some traces left in local words and names many of which closely resembled those found in dale or in rohan most notable were the names of days months and seasons several other words of the same sort were also still in common use while more were preserved in the placenames of bree and the shire the personal names of the hobbits were also peculiar and many had come down from ancient days hobbit was the name usually applied by the shirefolk to all their kind men called them halflings and the elves periannath the origin of the word hobbit was by most forgotten it seems however to have been at first a name given to the harfoots by the fallohides and stoors and to be a worndown form of a word preserved more fully in rohan holbytla holebuilder of other races ents the most ancient people surviving in the third age were the onodrim or enyd ent was the form of their name in the language of rohan they were known to the eldar in ancient days and to the eldar indeed the ents ascribed not their own language but the desire for speech the language that they had made was unlike all others slow sonorous agglomerated repetitive indeed longwinded formed of a multiplicity of vowelshades and distinctions of tone and quantity which even the loremasters of the eldar had not attempted to represent in writing they used it only among themselves but they had no need to keep it secret for no others could learn it ents were however themselves skilled in tongues learning them swiftly and never forgetting them but they preferred the languages of the eldar and loved best the ancient highelven tongue the strange words and names that the hobbits record as used by treebeard and other ents are thus elvish or fragments of elfspeech strung together in entfashion some are quenya as taurelilуmлatumbalemorna tumbaletaerлa lуmлanor which may be rendered forestmanyshadoweddeepvalleyblack deepvalleyforested gloomyland and by which treebeard meant more or less there is a black shadow in the deep dales of the forest some are sindarin as fangorn beard tree or fimbrethil slenderbeech orcs and the black speech orc is the form of the name that other races had for this foul people as it was in the language of rohan in sindarin it was orch related no doubt was the word uruk of the black speech though this was applied as a rule only to the great soldierorcs that at this time issued from mordor and isengard the lesser kinds were called especially by the urukhai snaga slave the orcs were first bred by the dark power of the north in the elder days it is said that they bad no language of their own but took what they could of other tongues and perverted it to their own liking yet they made only brutal jargons scarcely sufficient even for their own needs unless it were for curses and abuse and these creatures being filled with malice hating even their own kind quickly developed as many barbarous dialects as there were groups or settlements of their race so that their orkish speech was of little use to them in intercourse between different tribes so it was that in the third age orcs used for communication between breed and breed the westron tongue and many indeed of the older tribes such as those that still lingered in the north and in the misty mountains had long used the westron as their native language though in such a fashion as to make it hardly less unlovely than orkish in this jargon tark man of gondor was a debased form of tarkil a quenya word used in westron for one of nъmenorean descent see iii it is said that the black speech was devised by sauron in the dark years and that he bad desired to make it the language of all those that served him but he failed in that purpose from the black speech however were derived many of the words that were in the third age widespread among the orcs such as ghвsh fire but after the first overthrow of sauron this language in its ancient form was forgotten by all but the nazgыl when sauron arose again it became once more the language of baraddыr and of the captains of mordor the inscription on the ring was in the ancient black speech while the curse of the mordororc in ii was in the more debased form used by the soldiers of the dark tower of whom grishnбkh was the captain sharku in that tongue means old man trolls troll has been used to translate the sindarin torog in their beginning far back in the twilight of the elder days these were creatures of dull and lumpish nature and had no more language than beasts but sauron had made use of them teaching them what little they could learn and increasing their wits with wickedness trolls therefore took such language as they could master from the orcs and in the westlands the stonetrolls spoke a debased form of the common speech but at the end of the third age a trollrace not before seen appeared in southern mirkwood and in the mountain borders of mordor ologhai they were called in the black speech that sauron bred them none doubted though from what stock was not known some held that they were not trolls but giant orcs but the ologhai were in fashion of body and mind quite unlike even the largest of orckind whom they far surpassed in size and power trolls they were but filled with the evil will of their master a fell race strong agile fierce and cunning but harder than stone unlike the older race of the twilight they could endure the sun so long as the will of sauron held sway over them they spoke little and the only tongue that they knew was the black speech of baraddыr dwarves the dwarves are a race apart of their strange beginning and why they are both like and unlike elves and men the silmarillion tells but of this tale the lesser elves of middleearth had no knowledge while the tales of later men are confused with memories of other races they are a tough thrawn race for the most part secretive laborious retentive of the memory of injuries lovers of stone of gems of things that take shape under the hands of the craftsmen rather than things that live by their own life but they are not evil by nature and few ever served the enemy of free will whatever the tales of men may have alleged for men of old lusted after their wealth and the work of their hands and there has been enmity between the races but in the third age dose friendship still was found in many places between men and dwarves and it was according to the nature of the dwarves that travelling and labouring and trading about the lands as they did after the destruction of their ancient mansions they should use the languages of men among whom they dwelt yet in secret they used their own strange tongue changed little by the years for it had become a tongue of lore rather than a cradlespeech and they tended it and guarded it as a treasure of the past few of other race have succeeded in learning it in this history it appears only in such placenames as gimli revealed to his companions and in the battlecry which he uttered in the siege of the hornburg that at least was not secret and had been heard on many a field since the world was young baruk khazвd khazвd aimкnu axes of the dwarves the dwarves are upon you gimlis own name however and the names of all his kin are of northern origin their own secret and inner names their true names the dwarves have never revealed to any one of alien race not even on their tombs do they inscribe them ii on translation in presenting the matter of the red book as a history for people of today to read the whole of the linguistic setting has been translated as far as possible into terms of our own times only the languages alien to the common speech have been left in their original form but these appear mainly in the names of persons and places the common speech as the language of the hobbits and their narratives has inevitably been turned into modern english in the process the difference between the varieties observable in the use of the westron has been lessened some attempt has been made to represent these varieties by variations in the kind of english used but the divergence between the pronunciation and idiom of the shire and the westron tongue in the mouths of the elves or of the high men of gondor was greater than has been shown in this book hobbits indeed spoke for the most part a rustic dialect whereas in gondor and rohan a more antique language was used more formal and more terse one point in the divergence may here be noted since though often important it has proved impossible to represent the westron tongue made in the pronouns of the second person a distinction independent of number between familiar and deferential forms it was however one of the peculiarities of shireusage that the deferential forms had gone out of colloquial use they lingered only among the villagers especially of the westfarthing who used them as endearments this was one of the things referred to when people of gondor spoke of the strangeness of hobbitspeech peregrin took for instance in his first few days in minas tirith used the familiar forms to people of all ranks including the lord denethor himself this may have amused the aged steward but it must have astonished his servants no doubt this free use of the familiar forms helped to spread the popular rumour that peregrin was a person of very high rank in his own country it will be noticed that hobbits such as frodo and other persons such as gandalf and aragorn do not always use the same style this is intentional the more learned and able among the hobbits had some knowledge of booklanguage as it was termed in the shire and they were quick to note and adopt the style of those whom they met it was in any case natural for muchtravelled folk to speak more or less after the manner of those among whom they found themselves especially in the case of men who like aragorn were often at pains to conceal their origin and their business yet in those days all the enemies of the enemy revered what was ancient in language no less than in other matters and they took pleasure in it according to their knowledge the eldar being above all skilled in words had the command of many styles though they spoke most naturally in a manner nearest to their own speech one even more antique than that of gondor the dwarves too spoke with skill readily adapting themselves to their company though their utterance seemed to some rather harsh and guttural but orcs and trolls spoke as they would without love of words or things and their language was actually more degraded and filthy than i have shown it i do not suppose that any will wish for a closer rendering though models are easy to find much the same sort of talk can still be heard among the orcminded dreary and repetitive with hatred and contempt too long removed from good to retain even verbal vigour save in the ears of those to whom only the squalid sounds strong translation of this kind is of course usual because inevitable in any narrative dealing with the past it seldom proceeds any further but i have gone beyond it i have also translated all westron names according to their senses when english names or titles appear in this book it is an indication mat names in the common speech were current at the time beside or instead of those in alien languages the westron names were as a rule translations of older names as rivendell hoarwell silverlode langstrand the enemy the dark tower some differed in meaning as mount doom for orodruin burning mountain or mirkwood for taur endaedelos forest of the great fear a few were alterations of elvish names as lune and brandywine derived from lhыn and baranduin this procedure perhaps needs some defence it seemed to me that to present all the names in their original forms would obscure an essential feature of the times as perceived by the hobbits the contrast between a widespread language to them as ordinary and habitual as english is to us and the living remains of far older and more reverend tongues all names if merely transcribed would seem to modem readers equally remote for instance if the elvish name imladris and the westron translation karningul had both been left unchanged but to refer to rivendell as imladris was as if one now was to speak of winchester as camelot except that the identity was certain while in rivendell there still dwelt a lord of renown far older than arthur would be were he still king at winchester today the name of the shire and all other places of die hobbits have thus been englished this was seldom difficult since such names were commonly made up of elements similar to those used in our simpler english placenames either words still current like hill or field or a little worn down like ton beside town but some were derived as already noted from old hobbitwords no longer in use and these have been represented by similar english things such as wich or bottle dwelling or michel great in the case of persons however hobbitnames in the shire and in bree were for those days peculiar notably in the habit that had grown up some centuries before this time of having inherited names for families most of these surnames had obvious meanings in the current language being derived from jesting nicknames or from placenames or from the names of plants and trees translation of these presented little difficulty but there remained one or two older names of forgotten meaning and these i have been content to anglicize in spelling as took for tыk or boffin for bophоn i have treated hobbit firstnames as far as possible in the same way to their maidchildren hobbits commonly gave the names of flowers or jewels to their manchildren they usually gave names that had no meaning at all in their daily language and some of their womens names were similar of this kind are bilbo bungo polo lotho tanta nina and so on there are many inevitable but accidental resemblances to names that we now have or know for instance otho odo drogo dora cora and the like these names i have retained though i have usually anglicized them by altering their endings since in hobbitnames a was a masculine ending and o and e were feminine in some old families especially those of fallohide origin such as the tooks and the bolgers it was however the custom to give highsounding firstnames since most of these seem to have been drawn from legends of the past of men as well as of hobbits and many while now meaningless to hobbits closely resembled the names of men in the vale of anduin or in dale or in the mark i have turned them into those old names largely of frankish and gothic origin that are still used by us or are met in our histories i have thus at any rate preserved the often comic contrast between the firstnames and surnames of which the hobbits themselves were well aware names of classical origin have rarely been used for the nearest equivalents to latin and greek in shirelore were the elvish tongues and these the hobbits seldom used in nomenclature few of them at any time knew the languages of the kings as they called them the names of the bucklanders were different from those of the rest of the shire the folk of the marish and their offshoot across the brandywine were in many ways peculiar as has been told it was from the former language of the southern stoors no doubt that they inherited many of their very odd names these i have usually left unaltered for if queer now they were queer in their own day they had a style that we should perhaps feel vaguely to be celtic elements in england i have sometimes imitated the latter in my translation thus bree combe archet and chetwood are modelled on relics of british nomenclature chosen according to sense bree hill chet wood but only one personal name has been altered in this way meriadoc was chosen to fit the fact that this characters shortened name kali meant in the westron jolly gay though it was actually an abbreviation of the now unmeaning buckland name kalimac i have not used names of hebraic or similar origin in my transpositions nothing in hobbitnames corresponds to this element in our names short names such as sam tom tim mat were common as abbreviations of actual hobbitnames such as tomba tolma matta and the like but sam and his father ham were really called ban and ran these were shortenings of banazоr and ranugad originally nicknames meaning halfwise simple and stayathome but being words that had fallen out of colloquial use they remained as traditional names in certain families i have therefore tried to preserve these features by using samwise and hamfast modernizations of ancient english samwнs and hбmfoest which corresponded closely in meaning having gone so far in my attempt to modernize and make familiar the language and names of hobbits i found myself involved in a further process the mannish languages that were related to the westron should it seemed to me be turned into forms related to english the language of rohan i have accordingly made to resemble ancient english since it was related both to the common speech and to the former tongue of the northern hobbits and was in comparison with the westron archaic in the red book it is noted in several places that when hobbits heard the speech of rohan they recognized many words and felt the language to be akin to their own so that it seemed absurd to leave the recorded names and words of the rohirrim in a wholly alien style in several cases i have modernized the forms and spellings of placenames in rohan as in dunharrow or snowbourne but i have not been consistent for i have followed the hobbits they altered the names that they heard in the same way if they were made of elements mat they recognized or if they resembled placenames in the shire but many they left alone as i have done for instance in edoras the courts for the same reasons a few personal names have also been modernized as shadowfax and wormtongue this assimilation also provided a convenient way of representing the peculiar local hobbitwords that were of northern origin they have been given the forms that lost english words might well have had if they had come down to our day thus mathom is meant to recall ancient english mбthm and so to represent the relationship of the actual hobbit kast to r kastu similarly smial burrow is a likely form for a descendant of smygel and represents wen the relationship of hobbit tran to r trahan smйagol and dйagol are equivalents made up in the same way for the names trahald burrowing worming in and nahald secret in the northern tongues the still more northerly language of dale is in this book seen only in the names of the dwarves that came from that region and so used the language of the men there taking their outer names in that tongue it may be observed that in this book as in the hobbit the form dwarves is used although the dictionaries tell us that the plural of dwarf is dwarfs it should be dwarrows if singular and plural had each gone its own way down the years as have man and men or goose and geese but we no longer speak of a dwarf as often as we do of a man or even of a goose and memories have not been fresh enough among men to keep hold of a special plural for a race now abandoned to folktales where at least a shadow of truth is preserved or at last to nonsensestories in which they have become mere figures of fun but in the third age something of their old character and power is still glimpsed if already a little dimmed these are the descendants of the naugrim of the elder days in whose hearts still burns the ancient fire of aulл the smith and the embers smoulder of their long grudge against the elves and in whose hands still lives the skill in works of stone that none have surpassed it is to mark this that i have ventured to use the form dwarves and so remove them a little perhaps from the sillier tales of these latter days dwarrows would have been better but i have used that form only in the name dwarrowdelf to represent the name of moria in the common speech phurunargian for that meant dwarfdelving and yet was already word of antique form but moria is an elvish name and given without love for the eldar though they might at need in their bitter wars with the dark power and his servants contrive fortresses underground were not dwellers in such places of choice they were lovers of the green earth and the lights of heaven and moria in their tongue means the black chasm but the dwarves themselves and this name at least was never kept secret called it khazaddыm the mansion of the khazвd for such is their own name for their own race and has been so since aulл gave it to them at their making in the deeps of time elves has been used to translate both quendi the speakers the highelven name of all their kind and eldar the name of the three kindreds that sought for the undying realm and came there at the beginning of days this old word was indeed the only one available and was once fitted to apply to such memories of this people as men preserved or to the making of mens minds not wholly dissimilar but it has been diminished and to many it may now suggest fancies either pretty or silly as unlike to the quendi of old as are butterflies to the swift falcon not that any of the quendi ever possessed wings of the body as unnatural to them as to men they were a race high and beautiful the older children of the world and among them the eldar were as kings who now are gone the people of the great journey the people of the stars they were tall fair of skin and greyeyed though their locks were dark save in the golden house of finrod and their voices had more melodies than any mortal voice that now is heard they were valiant but the history of those that returned to middleearth in exile was grievous and though it was in faroff days crossed by the fate of the fathers their fate is not that of men their dominion passed long ago and they dwell now beyond the circles of the world and do not return note on three names hobbit gamgee and brandywinehobbit is an invention in the westron the word used when this people was referred to at all was banakil halfling but at this date the folk of the shire and of bree used the word kuduk which was not found elsewhere meriadoc however actually records that the king of rohan used the word kыddыkan holedweller since as has been noted the hobbits had once spoken a language closely related to that of the rohirrim it seems likely that kuduk was a worndown form of kыddыkan the latter i have translated for reasons explained by holbytla and hobbit provides a word that might well be a worndown form of holbytla it that name had occurred in our own ancient language gamgee according to family tradition set out in the red book the surname galbasi or in reduced form galpsi came from the village of galabas popularly supposed to be derived from galab game and an old element bas more or less equivalent to our wick wich gamwich seemed therefore a very fair rendering however in reducing gammidgy to gamgee to represent galpsi no reference was intended to the connexion of samwise with the family of cotton though a jest of that kind would have been hobbitlike enough had there been any warrant in their language cotton in fact represents hlothran a fairly common villagename in the shire derived from hloth a tworoomed dwelling or hole and ran a small group of such dwellings on a hillside as a surname it may be an alteration of hlothram cottager hlothram which i have rendered cotman was the name of farmer cottons grandfatherbrandywine the hobbitnames of this river were alterations of the elvish baranduin derived from baran golden brown and duin river of baranduin brandywine seemed a natural corruption in modern times actually the older hobbitname was brandanоn borderwater which would have been more closely rendered by marchbourn but by a jest that had become habitual referring again to its colour at this time the river was usually called braldahоm heady ale it must be observed however that when the oldbucks changed their name to brandybuck the first element meant borderland and marchbuck would have been nearer only a very bold hobbit would have ventured to call the master of buckland braldagamba in his hearing
